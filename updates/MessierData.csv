M1,"In 1054, Chinese astronomers took notice of a “guest star” that was, for nearly a month, visible in the daytime sky. The “guest star” they observed was actually a supernova explosion, which gave rise to the Crab Nebula, a six-light-year-wide remnant of the violent event.  With an apparent magnitude of 8.4 and located 6,500 light-years from Earth in the constellation Taurus, the Crab Nebula can be spotted with a small telescope and is best observed in January. The nebula was discovered by English astronomer John Bevis in 1731, and later observed by Charles Messier who mistook it for Halley’s Comet. Messier’s observation of the nebula inspired him to create a catalog of celestial objects that might be mistaken for comets.  This large mosaic of the Crab Nebula was assembled from 24 individual exposures captured by Hubble over three months. The colors in this image do not match exactly what we would see with our eyes but yield insight into the composition of this spectacular stellar corpse. The orange filaments are the tattered remains of the star and consist mostly of hydrogen. The blue in the filaments in the outer part of the nebula represents neutral oxygen. Green is singly ionized sulfur, and red indicates doubly ionized oxygen. These elements were expelled during the supernova explosion.  A rapidly spinning neutron star (the ultra-dense core of the exploded star) is embedded in the center of the Crab Nebula. Electrons whirling at nearly the speed of light around the star’s magnetic field lines produce the eerie blue light in the interior of the nebula. The neutron star, like a lighthouse, ejects twin beams of radiation that make it appear to pulse 30 times per second as it rotates.",M1,Supernova Remnant,8.4,8,6500,Taurus,NGC 1952
M2,"The first globular cluster to be added to the Messier catalog, M2 is located roughly 37,000 light-years from Earth in the constellation Aquarius. A globular cluster is a spherical group of stars that are bound together by their mutual gravitational attraction. M2 has a diameter of over 150 light-years and is one of the largest clusters of its kind. It was discovered in 1746 by the French astronomer Jean-Dominique Maraldi while he was observing a comet. M2 contains over 150,000 stars. Most of the cluster’s mass is concentrated at its center, with shimmering streams of stars extending outward into space. It has an apparent magnitude of 6.3 and can be seen with the naked eye in ideal viewing conditions. The best time to observe M2 is during the month of October. Large telescopes will resolve the cluster’s individual stars.",M5,Globular Cluster,6.5,11.7,33000,Aquarius,NGC 7089
M3,"The globular cluster M3 was the first object in the Messier catalog to be discovered by Charles Messier himself. Messier spotted the cluster in 1764, mistaking it for a nebula without any stars. This misunderstanding of M3’s nature was corrected in 1784 when William Herschel was able to resolve the cluster’s individual stars. Today it is known to contain over 500,000 stars.  M3 is notable for containing more variable stars than any other known cluster. The brightness of a variable star fluctuates with time. For some variable stars, their period relates to their intrinsic luminosity, so astronomers can use those stars’ brightness fluctuations to estimate their distances. This makes them extremely useful for measuring distances to deep-sky objects. M3 contains at least 274 variable stars. The cluster is located 34,000 light-years from Earth in the constellation Canes Venatici. It has an apparent magnitude of 6.2 and can be spotted using a pair of binoculars. The best time to observe M3 is during May.",M5,Globular Cluster,6.2,18.6,33900,Canes Venatici,NGC 5272
M4,"M4, located in the constellation Scorpius, is a huge, spherical collection of stars known as a globular cluster. Just 5,500 light-years away, it is the closest globular cluster to Earth. Because of its apparent magnitude of 5.9 and proximity to Antares, one of the brightest stars in the night sky, M4 is relatively easy to find with a small telescope. The cluster is best spotted in July.  M4 was discovered in 1746 by the Swiss astronomer Jean-Philippe Loys de Chéseaux. Home to more than 100,000 stars, the cluster is predicted to contain up to 40,000 white dwarfs — the cores of ancient, dead stars whose outer layers have drifted away into space. As white dwarfs age, they grow cooler, fainter, and more difficult to detect. Therefore, a globular cluster’s age can be inferred from the age of its faintest white dwarf. Because the stars in these clusters are some of the oldest in the universe, up to 13 billion years old, astronomers are able to use them to estimate the age of the universe.  The white dwarfs in M4 are less than one-billionth the apparent brightness of the faintest stars that can be seen with the naked eye. Even the brightest of the detected white dwarfs are no more luminous than a 100-watt light bulb seen at the moon’s distance. The faintest are comparable to a 2.5-watt night-light at the same distance.",M5,Globular Cluster,5.6,22.8,7200,Scorpius,NGC 6121
M5,"Discovered in 1702 by the German astronomer Gottfried Kirch, M5 is one of the oldest globular clusters in the Milky Way galaxy. With an apparent magnitude of 6.7 and a location 25,000 light-years away in the constellation Serpens, M5 appears as a patch of light with a pair of binoculars and is best viewed during July.  This image from Hubble captures M5 in stunning detail, resolving the patch of light into individual stars. A composite of exposures taken with visible and infrared cameras, this image features over 100,000 stars. A majority of M5’s stars formed more than 12 billion years ago, but there are some unexpected newcomers on the scene, adding some vitality to this aging population.  Stars in globular clusters are believed to form in the same stellar nursery and grow old together. The most massive stars age quickly, exhausting their fuel supply in less than a million years, and end their lives in spectacular supernova explosions. This process should have left the ancient cluster M5 with only old, low-mass stars.  Yet astronomers have spotted many young, blue stars amongst the ancient stars in this cluster. Astronomers think that these laggard youngsters, called blue stragglers, were created either by collisions between stars or other stellar interactions. Such events are easy to imagine in densely populated globular clusters, in which up to a few million stars are tightly packed together.",M5,Globular Cluster,5.7,19.9,24500,Serpens,NGC 5904
M6,"Messier 6 (M6), also known as the Butterfly Cluster, is a bright open cluster located in the southern constellation Scorpius.  The Butterfly Cluster lies in the direction of the galactic centre, at an approximate distance of 1,600 light years from Earth.  Messier 6 was named the Butterfly Cluster by the American astronomer Robert Burnham, who described it as a “charming group whose arrangement suggests the outline of a butterfly with open wings.” The cluster has an apparent magnitude of 4.2. Its designation in the New General Catalogue is NGC 6405.       Messier 6 is estimated to be around 100,000 million years old. Most of the bright, visible stars in it are hot, young, blue stars belonging to the spectral class B4-B5. However, the brightest star in the cluster is an orange giant belonging to the spectral class K.",M6,Open Cluster,4,20,1600,Scorpius,NGC 6405
M7,"Messier 7 (M7), also known as Ptolemy’s Cluster, is a bright open cluster in Scorpius constellation.  The cluster lies at an approximate distance of 980 light years from Earth. It has the designation NGC 6475 in the New General Catalogue. With a visual magnitude of 3.3 and an apparent diameter of 80 arc minutes – more than twice the apparent size of the full Moon – Ptolemy’s Cluster is an easy naked-eye target.  Messier 7 can be seen near the stinger of the celestial scorpion. The cluster is the southernmost Messier object in the sky, which makes it a challenging object for those in northern latitudes as Scorpius constellation never rises very high above the horizon.       The best time of year to observe M7 is in the summer months. Because of its large size, the cluster is best seen in binoculars.  Messier 7 can be found 4.75 degrees northeast of the star Lambda Scorpii, also known as Shaula.  Shaula marks the scorpion’s stinger and is the second brightest star in Scorpius constellation, fainter only than the red supergiant Antares.",M7,Open Cluster,3,80,980,Scorpius,NGC 6475
M8,"Commonly known as the Lagoon Nebula, M8 was discovered in 1654 by the Italian astronomer Giovanni Battista Hodierna, who, like Charles Messier, sought to catalog nebulous objects in the night sky so they would not be mistaken for comets. This star-forming cloud of interstellar gas is located in the constellation Sagittarius and its apparent magnitude of 6 makes it faintly visible to the naked eye in dark skies. The best time to observe M8 is during August.   Located 5,200 light-years from Earth, M8 is home to its own star cluster: NGC 6530 (not visible in the image above). The massive stars embedded within the nebula give off enormous amounts of ultraviolet radiation, ionizing the gas and causing it to shine.  In Hubble’s image of the center of the Lagoon Nebula, dust masks most of the objects within. This image maps the emission from the nebula’s ionized gas. Hydrogen is colored red and nitrogen is green. The blue-white flare at the upper left of the image is scattered light from a bright star just outside the field of view.",M8,Cluster with Nebula,5,45,4100,Sagittarius,NGC 6523
M9,"Located only 25,000 light-years away in the constellation Ophiuchus, M9 is one of the closest globular clusters to the center of our Milky Way galaxy. The stars in the globular cluster are gravitationally bound to each other, with most of the stars concentrated at the cluster’s center. This large central mass pulls outer stars inward and causes globular clusters to have a spherical shape. M9’s proximity to the much greater mass at the center of the Milky Way has warped the cluster’s shape, though, so it appears less spherical than other objects of its kind.  M9 was discovered by Charles Messier in 1764. It has an apparent magnitude of 8.4 and can be observed using a small telescope. The best time of year to spot the cluster is during the month of July.",M5,Globular Cluster,7.7,5.5,25800,Ophiuchus,NGC 6333
M10,"Discovered by Charles Messier in 1764, M10 is a globular cluster located in the constellation Ophiuchus. It is roughly 15,000 light-years from Earth and has an apparent magnitude of 6.4. This cluster can be spotted using a pair of binoculars and is most easily observed during July.  M10 is notable for its high population of blue stragglers — stars that appear to be far younger than their neighbors. The stars in globular clusters are thought to have formed and aged together, so they should all be roughly the same age. These anomalous, bluer stars were created either by collisions between stars or other stellar interactions. Such events are easy to imagine in densely populated globular clusters, in which up to a few million stars are tightly packed together.",M5,Globular Cluster,6.6,12.2,14300,Ophiuchus,NGC 6254
M11,"M11 is one of the few open star clusters in the Messier catalog that has been observed by Hubble. Unlike the many globular clusters Hubble has imaged, open clusters are groups of stars that are only loosely bound by gravity. The lifespans of open clusters are relatively short when compared to those of globular clusters. This is because the gravitational interactions between members of open clusters are comparatively weak, so stars do not remain bound for long before they are drawn away by stronger gravitational forces.  Also known as the Wild Duck Cluster for the roughly V-shaped arrangement of its brightest stars, M11 was discovered by the German astronomer Gottfried Kirch in 1681. It is located 6,200 light-years from Earth in the constellation Scutum and has an apparent magnitude of 6.3. Of the 26 open clusters included in the Messier catalog, M11 is the most distant that can be seen with the naked eye. The best time to spot the cluster is in August. M11 is one of the most densely populated open clusters known. Containing over 2,900 stars, it appears as a triangular patch of light through a pair of binoculars.  This Hubble image of a portion of the cluster was created using observations at visible and ultraviolet wavelengths. The black stripe through the middle of the image results from a gap between the two detectors of the camera that made the observations.",M11,Open Cluster,5.8,14,6200,Scutuum,NGC 6705
M12,"M12 was discovered by Charles Messier in 1764. The globular cluster is located 23,000 light-years from Earth in the constellation Ophiuchus. It has an apparent magnitude of 7.7 and can be observed with a pair of binoculars most easily in July.    Because globular clusters like M12 have such high concentrations of stars, they often contain binary star systems — systems of two stars that are locked in orbit around each other. As the stars interact, material from one star can be transferred to its companion, producing X-rays in the process. These X-rays serve as a signature of interacting binary systems, and many have been detected in M12. This is unexpected because M12 is a relatively diffuse globular cluster, so stars should be less likely to interact than if they were in clusters with a higher concentration of stars.  M12 also has fewer low-mass stars than expected. Astronomers suspect that gravity has ripped many low-mass stars from M12 as the cluster passed through denser regions of the Milky Way during its orbit around the galaxy’s center. M12 is thought to have lost up to one million stars this way.",M5,Globular Cluster,6.7,12.2,15700,Ophiuchus,NGC 6218
M13,"Like shiny flakes sparkling in a snow globe, over 100,000 stars whirl within the globular cluster M13, one of the brightest star clusters visible from the Northern Hemisphere. Located 25,000 light-years from Earth with an apparent magnitude of 5.8, this glittering metropolis of stars in the constellation Hercules can be spotted with a pair of binoculars most easily in July.  The English astronomer Edmond Halley, best known for recognizing the periodicity of the comet that bears his name, discovered M13 in 1714. When Charles Messier added M13 to his catalog in 1764, he was convinced that the nebulous object did not contain any stars at all. Because they are so densely packed together, the cluster’s individual stars were not resolved until 1779. Near the core of this cluster, the density of the stellar population is about a hundred times greater than the density in the neighborhood of our sun. These stars are so crowded that they can, at times, run into each other and even form a new star. The resulting “blue stragglers” appear to be younger than the other stars in their immediate vicinity and are of great scientific interest to astronomers.",M5,Globular Cluster,5.8,23.2,22200,Hercules,NGC 6205
M14,"Discovered by Charles Messier in 1764, the globular cluster M14 is home to over 150,000 stars and has an apparent magnitude of 8.3. It is located 29,000 light-years away from Earth in the constellation Ophiuchus, and is best observed with a telescope during July.  In the summer of 1938, M14 played host to a nova — an extraordinarily rare event in a cluster of its kind. A nova is a sudden stellar eruption where, in just a few days, a star’s brightness increases by a factor of 10,000. Then over the following months the outburst fades away and the star returns to its normal brightness.  This image of M14 was assembled using both infrared and visible-light observations from Hubble. Its stair-step appearance results from the design of the camera used to take the exposures. The camera consisted of four light detectors, one of which provided a higher resolution but had a smaller field of view than the other three. Because the detector with the higher resolution did not cover as much area as the others, black regions are left around its image segment when the exposures from all four detectors are combined into one picture.

M15,"A spectacular swarm of stars, M15 was discovered in 1746 by Jean-Dominique Maraldi, an Italian astronomer on the hunt for comets. This globular cluster is one of the densest ever discovered, with very hot blue stars and cooler orange stars becoming more concentrated toward its bright core. M15 is located in the constellation Pegasus 33,600 light-years from Earth. Shining with an apparent magnitude of 6.2, the cluster can be spotted with a pair of binoculars. The best time to observe it is in October. M15 was the first globular cluster known to host a planetary nebula (the gaseous shell of a dying star). This nebula, Pease 1, was detected in 1928 by Francis G. Pease and is one of only four planetary nebulas known to exist within a globular cluster. This cluster has also been found to host a rare type of black hole at its center: an intermediate-mass black hole. Supermassive black holes are found at the center of galaxies and can be billions of times more massive than the sun. More diminutive “stellar” black holes, on the other hand, are on the order of 10 solar masses. The black hole thought to exist at the center of M15, however, is 4,000 times the mass of the sun.",M5,Globular Cluster,6.2,12.3,33000,Pegasus,NGC 7078
M16,"These towering tendrils of cosmic dust and gas sit at the heart of M16, or the Eagle Nebula. The aptly named Pillars of Creation, featured in this stunning Hubble image, are part of an active star-forming region within the nebula and hide newborn stars in their wispy columns.  Although this is not Hubble’s first image of this iconic feature of the Eagle Nebula, it is the most detailed. The blue colors in the image represent oxygen, red is sulfur, and green represents both nitrogen and hydrogen. The pillars are bathed in the scorching ultraviolet light from a cluster of young stars located just outside the frame. The winds from these stars are slowly eroding the towers of gas and dust.  Stretching roughly 4 to 5 light-years, the Pillars of Creation are a fascinating but relatively small feature of the entire Eagle Nebula, which spans 70 by 55 light-years. The nebula, discovered in 1745 by the Swiss astronomer Jean-Philippe Loys de Chéseaux, is located 7,000 light-years from Earth in the constellation Serpens. With an apparent magnitude of 6, the Eagle Nebula can be spotted through a small telescope and is best viewed during July.

M17,"Illuminated by ultraviolet radiation from young, massive stars on the right side of this photograph, M17, also known as the Omega Nebula or Swan Nebula, is one of the largest star-forming regions in the Milky Way galaxy. Hubble’s stunning image of a central portion of the nebula has been colorized to highlight certain wavelengths of light. Green represents oxygen while red reveals hydrogen and infrared light.  The Omega Nebula was discovered in 1745 by the Swiss astronomer Jean-Philippe Loys de Chéseaux. It is located 5,500 light-years from Earth in the constellation Sagittarius. The nebula has an apparent magnitude of 6 and can be seen with a pair of binoculars. M17, which appears near M16 and M18 in the sky, is best viewed on clear nights in August.  M17 contains one of our galaxy’s youngest star clusters, at only 1 million years old. However, many of the young stars in this cluster are impossible to see because of the gas and dust that surrounds them. The powerful radiation from the young stars evaporates and erodes the dense clouds of cold gas in which new stars form. One such pocket of gas is seen at the center of the brightest region of the nebula (near the bottom of this image) and is about 10 times larger than our solar system. Other dense pockets of gas have formed the remarkable dark features jutting inward from the bottom left corner of the image.",M17,Cluster with Nebula,6,11,5500,Sagittarius,NGC 6618

It has an apparent magnitude of 7.7 and can be spotted through a pair of binoculars, though it will only appear as a faint patch of light. Large telescopes will resolve M19’s individual stars.  The stars in globular clusters orbit about a common center of gravity, so these clusters are usually spherical. Some globular clusters, like M19, have a slightly elongated shape. This cluster is only 6,500 light-years away from the center of our Milky Way galaxy, so the gravity and tidal forces from the massive galactic center could be causing M19 to stretch out.",M19,Globular Cluster,6.8,5.3,28700,Ophiuchus,NGC 6273
M20,"Discovered by Charles Messier in 1764, M20 is a star-forming nebula located 9,000 light-years away from Earth in the constellation Sagittarius. Also known as the Trifid Nebula, M20 has an apparent magnitude of 6.3 and can be spotted with a small telescope. It is best observed during August.  This eerie Hubble image features the center of the Trifid Nebula and the three wing-like bands of thick dust for which the nebula was named. A group of recently formed, massive, bright stars toward the center of the nebula is easily visible. These stars are releasing a flood of ultraviolet radiation that dramatically influences the structure and evolution of the surrounding nebula. Star formation is no longer occurring in the immediate vicinity of this group of bright stars because their intense radiation has blown away the gas and dust from which new stars are made.  The image’s stair-step appearance results from the design of the camera used to take the exposures. The camera consisted of four light detectors, one of which provided a higher resolution but had a smaller field of view than the other three.

M27,"Spotted by Charles Messier in 1764, M27 was the first planetary nebula ever discovered. The term “planetary nebula” is a bit of a misnomer based on the nebula’s round, planet-like appearance when viewed through smaller telescopes. The nebula is the result of an old star that has shed its outer layers in a glowing display of color. In Hubble’s image, which shows a small portion of M27, blue represents oxygen, green represents hydrogen, and red indicates sulfur and nitrogen.  M27 hosts many knots of gas and dust. As depicted in Hubble’s image, some look like fingers pointing at the central star, located just off the upper left of the image; others are isolated clouds, some with and some without tails. Their sizes typically range from 17 billion to 56 billion kilometers, which is several times larger than the distance from the sun to Pluto. Each contains as much mass as three Earths.  These dense knots of gas and dust seem to be a natural part of the evolution of planetary nebulas. They form when the stellar winds are not powerful enough to blow away a larger clump of matter but are able to blow away smaller particles, creating a trail behind the clump. The shapes of these knots change as the nebula expands. Similar knots have been discovered in other nearby planetary nebulas that are all part of the same evolutionary scheme.

This makes it appear to be pulsing to observers on Earth. PSR B1821–24 was discovered in 1986 using a radio telescope in England called the Lovell Telescope.",M5,Globular Cluster,6.8,15,17900,Sagittarius,NGC 6626

Messier 29 is too faint to be spotted by the naked eye, but can be seen in binoculars. It is best observed in telescopes at the lowest powers. The cluster lies at an approximate distance of 4,000 light years from Earth. It has the designation NGC 6913 in the New General Catalogue. Messier 29 is relatively small, occupying an area of 7 arc minutes in the sky, or a quarter the size of the full Moon.

M30,"M30 was discovered by Charles Messier in 1764. It is located roughly 28,000 light-years from Earth in the constellation Capricornus. It has an apparent magnitude of 7.7 and can be seen through a pair of binoculars. M30 is best observed during September. Although globular clusters such as M30 are mainly populated by old stars, the density of the stellar swarm leads to some old stars apparently reclaiming their youth as “blue stragglers.” Using observations from Hubble, astronomers have identified two types of blue stragglers in M30: those that form in near head-on collisions between two stars and those that are in binary systems where one star siphons hydrogen from its companion.

M31,"Assembled from a total of 7,398 exposures taken over 411 individual pointings of the telescope, this image of our nearest major galactic neighbor, M31, is the largest Hubble mosaic to date. The 1.5 billion pixels in the mosaic reveal over 100 million stars and thousands of star clusters embedded in a section of the pancake-shaped disk of M31, also known as the Andromeda galaxy. Though the galaxy is over 2 million light-years away, Hubble is powerful enough to resolve individual stars in this 61,000-light-year-long stretch of the disk. It’s like photographing a beach and resolving individual grains of sand.  Hubble traces densely packed stars extending from the innermost hub of the galaxy, seen at left. Moving out from this central galactic bulge, the panorama sweeps across lanes of stars and dust to the sparser outer disk. Cooler, yellowish stars dominate the center of the galaxy, toward the lower left. The blue, ring-like feature that wraps from the upper left to the lower right is a spiral arm with numerous clusters of young, blue stars and star-forming regions. The dark silhouettes trace out complex dust structures.  M31 is located in the constellation Andromeda and is best observed in November. Boasting an apparent magnitude of 3.1, the galaxy can be seen with the naked eye, even in areas with moderate light pollution. Because it is such an easily observed feature in the night sky, it is impossible to say who discovered the Andromeda galaxy. However, Persian astronomer Abd al-rahman al-Sufi’s The Book of Fixed Stars from the year 964 contains the first known report of the object.",M31,Galaxy,4.3,189.1,254000000,Andromeda,NGC 224
M32,"Hubble has captured nearly 8,000 blue stars swirling around the core of M32 like a blizzard of snowflakes. This elliptical galaxy is located 2.5 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Andromeda and is one of two satellite galaxies orbiting M31, the Andromeda galaxy.  The first ultraviolet observations of elliptical galaxies showed that they were surprisingly bright when viewed in ultraviolet light. There is evidence that the ultraviolet light comes from a population of extremely hot, helium-burning stars at a late stage in their lives. Unlike the sun, which burns hydrogen into helium, these old stars exhausted their central hydrogen long ago and now burn helium into heavier elements. M32 was discovered by the French astronomer Guillaume Le Gentil in 1749 and is best observed in November. The galaxy has an apparent magnitude of 8.1, and can be seen using a medium-sized telescope. It is relatively easy to locate, as it falls in the same field of view as M31, but a large telescope is needed to resolve any detail beyond a spot of light.",M105,Galaxy,9.1,8.5,249000000,Andromeda,NGC 221
M33,"Spiral galaxy M33 is located in the triangle-shaped constellation Triangulum, earning it the nickname the Triangulum galaxy. About half the size of our Milky Way galaxy, M33 is the third-largest member of our Local Group of galaxies following the Andromeda galaxy (M31) and the Milky Way. Comprised of 54 separate Hubble fields of view, this image is the largest high-resolution mosaic of M33 assembled to date by any observatory. It resolves 25 million individual stars in a 14,000-light-year-wide region spanning the center of the galaxy.  Blue-colored regions scattered throughout the image reveal numerous sites of rapid star birth in M33. In fact, Hubble’s observations reveal that the Triangulum galaxy’s star formation rate is ten times higher than the average found in the Andromeda galaxy, previously surveyed by Hubble in similar detail. A bright blue patch in the lower left of this image, called NGC 604, is the largest star-forming region in M33 and one of the largest stellar nurseries in the entire Local Group.  The Triangulum galaxy’s orderly spiral structure displays few signs of interactions with nearby galaxies. However, that could change in the future. Only slightly farther away from us than the Andromeda galaxy, about 3 million light-years from Earth, M33 is a suspected gravitational companion to Andromeda, and both galaxies are moving toward our own. M33 could become a third party involved in the impending collision between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies more than 4 billion years from now.  M33 has a relatively bright apparent magnitude of 5.7, making it one of the most distant objects that keen-eyed observers can view with the unaided eye (under exceptionally clear and dark skies). Although a telescope will start to reveal some of M33’s spiral features, the diffuse galaxy is actually easiest to examine with low magnification and a wide field of view, such as through binoculars. It is best observed in October.  Although others may have viewed the galaxy earlier, Charles Messier was the first to catalog M33 after observing it in August 1764. In the 1920s, astronomer Edwin Hubble studied dozens of variable stars (those that periodically change brightness) in M33, which helped him to estimate the object’s distance and prove that M33 is not a nebula within our own galaxy, as previously suspected, but actually a separate galaxy outside our own.",M33,Galaxy,6.2,68.7,2500000,Triangulum,NGC 598

Messier 34 is pretty easy to find in the sky and its stars can be resolved even in 10×50 binoculars. The cluster is located just to the north of the imaginary line drawn from Algol (Beta Persei), the second brightest star in Perseus, to Almach (Gamma Andromedae), the third brightest star in the neighbouring constellation Andromeda. The cluster lies 5 degrees northwest of Algol, a famous eclipsing binary star also known as the Demon Star, that represents the head of the Gorgon Medusa, held by Perseus after his victory over the snake-haired monster.  The best way to view M34 is in telescopes at low magnifications. Small telescopes will reveal up to 20 stars, while larger amateur telescopes show about 80 members, many of them arranged in pairs.

The cluster has an apparent magnitude of 6.3 and lies at a distance of 4,100 light years from Earth. It has the designation NGC 1960 in the New General Catalogue.  The Pinwheel Cluster contains at least 60 stars and bears a resemblance to the more famous Pleiades cluster (M45) in the constellation Taurus. The two clusters have almost the same physical size and, like many members of the Pleiades cluster, many members of M36 are also rapid spinners. M36, however, is one of the most distant open clusters catalogued by Messier and about 10 times as far away as the Pleiades.       Messier 36 is one of the fainter open clusters in Messier’s catalogue, but it can easily be seen in binoculars and small telescopes. Binoculars will show a faint, fuzzy patch of light and small telescopes at low or medium powers will reveal just over a dozen brightest stars in the cluster, arranged in an X-type shape.  6-inch telescopes will resolve about 25 stars, while 12-inch instruments will reveal stars across the cluster.",M47,Open Cluster,6,12,4110,Auriga,NGC 1960

The cluster has an apparent magnitude of 6.2 and lies at a distance of 4,511 light years from Earth.  Messier 37 can be found by first identifying the pentagon shape formed by the brightest stars in Auriga. The constellation lies in the northern sky, to the northeast of Taurus and northwest of Gemini.       Capella, the sixth brightest star in the sky marks the northern point of the polygon. To the east of Capella is Menkalinan (Beta Aurigae) and to the south of Menkalinan is Mahasim (Theta Aurigae). M37 lies east of the midpoint of the line drawn from Mahasim to Elnath in Taurus, which lies to the southwest. Being the easternmost of the three Messier clusters in Auriga, M37 is the only one found outside Auriga‘s pentagon asterism.  In 10×50 binoculars, M37 appears as a hazy patch of light, but 20×80 and larger binoculars reveal a very compact star cluster, resolving the brightest stars.

M42,"Believed to be the cosmic fire of creation by the Maya of Mesoamerica, M42 blazes brightly in the constellation Orion. Popularly called the Orion Nebula, this stellar nursery has been known to many different cultures throughout human history. The nebula is only 1,500 light-years away, making it the closest large star-forming region to Earth and giving it a relatively bright apparent magnitude of 4. Because of its brightness and prominent location just below Orion’s belt, M42 can be spotted with the naked eye, while offering an excellent peek at stellar birth for those with telescopes. It is best observed during January.  The Mayan culture’s likening of the Orion Nebula to a cosmic fire of creation is very apt. The nebula is an enormous cloud of dust and gas where vast numbers of new stars are being forged. Its bright, central region is the home of four massive, young stars that shape the nebula. The four hefty stars are called the Trapezium because they are arranged in a trapezoidal pattern. Ultraviolet light unleashed by these stars is carving a cavity in the nebula and disrupting the growth of hundreds of smaller stars.  This stunning Hubble image offers the sharpest view of the Orion Nebula ever obtained. Created using 520 different Hubble exposures taken in multiple wavelengths of light, this mosaic contains over one billion pixels. Hubble imaged most of the nebula, but ground-based images were used to fill in the gaps in its observations. The orange color in the image can be attributed to hydrogen, green represents oxygen, and the red represents both sulfur and observations made in infrared light.",nebula,Diffuse Nebula,4,90,1345,Orion,NGC 1976
M43,"Separated from the Orion Nebula (M42) by only a dark lane of dust, M43 was recognized as a distinct nebula by the French astronomer Jean-Jacques d’Ortous de Mairan in 1731. A massive star is illuminating M43 and sculpting its landscape of dust and gas with its radiation. Astronomers call the area a miniature Orion Nebula because of its small size and the single star that is shaping it. The Orion Nebula itself is much larger and has four hefty stars that are carving the dust-and-gas terrain.  Both nebulas are part of the massive stellar nursery called the Orion Molecular Cloud Complex, which includes several other nebulas, such as the Horsehead Nebula (Barnard 33) and the Flame Nebula (NGC 2024). At the center of this view of M43, taken using infrared and visible-light cameras on Hubble, sits the massive star that is warping the gas and dust around it.

M45,"Commonly called the Pleiades or Seven Sisters, M45 is known as an open star cluster. It contains over a thousand stars that are loosely bound by gravity, but it is visually dominated by a handful of its brightest members.  One of these stars, Merope, is located just outside the frame of this image to the upper right. The colorful rays of light at the upper right, emanating from the star, are an optical phenomenon produced within the telescope. The nearly straight, blue-white wisps pointing toward the upper right are streams of large dust particles. As the cloud moves toward Merope, its smaller dust particles are slowed down by the star’s radiation pressure more than the larger particles are. The large dust particles continue on toward the star while the smaller particles are left behind at the lower left of the picture.  The Pleiades cluster has been observed since ancient times, so it has no known discoverer. However, Galileo Galilei, the Italian scientist best known for discovering the largest moons of Jupiter and championing a heliocentric model of the solar system, was the first to observe the Pleiades through a telescope.

M51,"The graceful, winding arms of the majestic spiral galaxy M51 appear like a grand spiral staircase sweeping through space. They are actually long lanes of stars and gas laced with dust. Such striking arms are a hallmark of so-called grand-design spiral galaxies. In M51, also known as the Whirlpool galaxy, these arms serve an important purpose: they are star-formation factories, compressing hydrogen gas and creating clusters of new stars.  Some astronomers think that the Whirlpool’s arms are particularly prominent because of the effects of a close encounter with NGC 5195, the small, yellowish galaxy at the outermost tip of one of the arms. The compact galaxy appears to be tugging on the arm, the tidal forces from which trigger new star formation. Hubble’s clear view shows that NGC 5195 is passing behind M51. The small galaxy has been gliding past the Whirlpool for hundreds of millions of years.  In Hubble’s captivating image of M51, the red represents infrared light as well as hydrogen within giant star-forming regions. The blue color can be attributed to hot, young stars while the yellow color is from older stars.  Discovered by Charles Messier in 1773, M51 is located 31 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Canes Venatici.

More stars are visible in 6-inch and larger instruments. The cluster occupies an area just less than half of the size of the full Moon.  Messier 52 is very easy to find as it lies near Cassiopeia‘s prominent W asterism, formed by the constellation’s brightest stars.  The cluster can be located by extending the line from Schedar, Alpha Cassiopeiae, to Caph, Beta Cassiopeiae to the northwest about the same distance as that between the two stars. The cluster lies only a degree south of the star 4 Cassiopeiae. The best time of year to observe it is during the autumn.",M35,Open Cluster,6.9,13,5000,Cassiopeia,NGC 7654
M53,"Thousands and thousands of brilliant stars make up the globular cluster named Messier 53. Bound tightly by gravity, the cluster is roughly spherical and becomes denser toward its heart. Discovered by the German astronomer Johann Elert Bode in 1775, M53 is 59,700 light-years away, one of the most distant globular clusters from Earth. Best observed in May, it has an apparent magnitude of 8.3 and can be seen through a small telescope in the constellation Coma Berenices. Larger instruments will resolve the cluster’s individual stars.  Globular clusters are much older and larger than open clusters, so they are generally expected to contain more elderly, red stars and fewer young, blue stars. But Messier 53 has surprised astronomers with its unusual number of a type of star called blue stragglers. All the stars in a globular cluster are expected to form around the same time, so they are expected to be roughly the same age. But blue stragglers appear to be brighter and more youthful than they should be. Although their precise nature remains mysterious, these unusual objects are probably formed by close encounters, possibly collisions, between stars in the crowded centers of globular clusters like M53.",M5,Globular Cluster,7.6,14.4,58000,Coma Berenices,NGC 5024
M54,"The dense group of stars known as M54 was the first globular cluster found outside our galaxy. M54 belongs to a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way called the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy. When Charles Messier discovered M54 in 1778, he did not know that the cluster belonged to another galaxy.  Even though M54 is now understood to lie outside the Milky Way, it will become part of our galaxy in the future. The strong gravitational pull of our large galaxy is slowly engulfing the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, which will eventually merge with the Milky Way to create one larger galaxy.  M54 is located roughly 90,000 light-years from Earth. It has an apparent magnitude of 8.4 and can be spotted in the constellation Sagittarius most easily during August. Binoculars will resolve a small patch of light in the sky, but larger telescopes are needed to resolve individual stars.",M5,Globular Cluster,7.6,9.1,87400,Sagittarius,NGC 6715
M55,"Messier 55 (M55), also known as the Summer Rose Star, is a globular cluster located in the constellation Sagittarius.  The cluster has an apparent magnitude of 7.42 and lies at a distance of 17,600 light years from Earth. It has the designation NGC 6809 in the New General Catalogue. Messier 55 occupies 19 arc minutes of apparent sky, which is almost two thirds the size of the full Moon.  The cluster has a linear diameter of almost 100 light years. It can be seen in 50 mm binoculars, but can only be resolved in medium-sized and larger telescopes. 8-inch telescopes will easily resolve many of the cluster’s stars.",M5,Globular Cluster,6.3,19.1,17600,Sagittarius,NGC 6809
M56,"Charles Messier discovered the globular cluster M56 in 1779. The cluster is located 33,000 light-years away from Earth in the constellation Lyra. It has an apparent magnitude of 8.3 and can be observed with a small telescope most easily in August. Using various observations by Hubble, astronomers have been able to study the chemical composition of the cluster. M56 has relatively few elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, which is a sign that its stars were born early in the universe’s history before many of the elements in existence today were formed in significant quantities.  Astronomers have found that most of clusters with this type of chemical makeup lie along a plane in the Milky Way’s halo. This suggests that such clusters were captured from a satellite galaxy, rather than being the oldest members of the Milky Way’s globular cluster system as astronomers had previously thought.",M5,Globular Cluster,8.3,5,32900,Lyra,NGC 6779
M57,"M57, or the Ring Nebula, is a planetary nebula, the glowing remains of a sun-like star. The tiny white dot in the center of the nebula is the star’s hot core, called a white dwarf. M57 is about 2,000 light-years away in the constellation Lyra, and is best observed during August. Discovered by the French astronomer Antoine Darquier de Pellepoix in 1779, the Ring Nebula has an apparent magnitude of 8.8 and can be spotted with moderately sized telescopes.  M57 is tilted toward Earth so that astronomers see the ring face-on. This gorgeous, high-resolution Hubble image helped astronomers determine that the nebula’s shape is more complicated than initially thought. The blue gas in the nebula’s center is actually a football-shaped structure seen end-on that pierces the red, doughnut-shaped material. The inner rim of the ring displays an intricate structure of dark, irregular knots of dense gas that the stellar winds have not yet been able to blow away. The knots and their tails look like spokes in a bicycle.  This image of M57 has been colorized to illustrate the nebula’s chemical composition. The deep blue color in the center represents helium, the light blue color of the inner ring is the glow of hydrogen and oxygen, and the reddish color of the outer ring is from nitrogen and sulfur.",M57,Planetary Nebula,9.7,1.18,2300,Lyra,NGC 6720
M58,"Discovered in 1779 by Charles Messier, M58 was one of the first galaxies recognized to have a spiral shape and is one of four barred spiral galaxies in Messier’s catalog. M58 is one of the brightest galaxies in the constellation Virgo. Located roughly 62 million light-years from Earth, M58 is the most distant Messier object.  Although it appears bright, M58’s core is relatively dim compared to other spiral galaxies. The core contains high rates of star formation, known as starburst activity. It also houses a supermassive black hole around 70 million times the mass of our Sun. A very small ring around the galaxy’s nucleus, known as an ultra-compact nuclear ring, is a main region of widespread starburst activity in M58 and is a rare phenomenon among galaxies.  Long arms extend out from the galaxy’s bright nucleus. However, a lack of hydrogen means that there is very little star formation activity in the arms. This could be the result of gravitational interactions with the nearby galaxies of the Virgo cluster. Two supernovas have been detected in M58, one in 1988 and the other in 1989.  The best time to view M58 is in May. With a magnitude of 9.8, the galaxy is best observed with an 8-inch or larger telescope, but it can be seen with large binoculars on clear nights as well. Small telescopes will only reveal the galaxy’s core.  This Hubble observation was taken in ultraviolet and visible light using the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2. The image’s stair-step appearance results from the design of the camera. It shows about half of M58, with the galaxy’s core and arms filling the image. Hubble took these observations of M58 to study the properties of its nucleus (classified as a LINER, or low-ionization nuclear emission-line region) and compare it with active galactic nuclei in the centers of other galaxies.",M58,Galaxy,10.4,6,62000000,Virgo,NGC 4579
M59,"M59 is one of the largest elliptical galaxies in the Virgo galaxy cluster. However, it is still considerably less massive, and at a magnitude of 9.8, less luminous than other elliptical galaxies in the cluster.  A supermassive black hole around 270 million times as massive as the Sun resides at the center of M59. The galaxy also has an inner disk of stars and around 2,200 globular clusters, an exceptionally high number of such clusters. The central region of the galaxy, the inner 200 light-years, rotates in the opposite direction than the rest of the galaxy and is the smallest region in a galaxy known to exhibit this behavior.  Approximately 60 million light-years from Earth, M59 can be found near M58 and M60 in the constellation Virgo. It is best seen in May. Small telescopes might reveal an ellipsoidal shape with a bright center, but even larger scopes do not reveal much detail.  German astronomer Johann Gottfried Koehler discovered M59 and the nearby galaxy M60 in the spring of 1779 when observing the comet of that year (Comet Bode). While observing that same comet, Charles Messier observed and added M59, M60 and the neighboring M58 to his catalog.",M105,Galaxy,10.7,5.3,60000000,Virgo,NGC 4621
M60,"The Virgo cluster is a collection of more than 1,300 galaxies, including the elliptical galaxy M60. Unlike spiral galaxies, elliptical galaxies lack an organized structure and are nearly featureless, resembling the core of a spiral galaxy. The Virgo cluster’s third brightest member, M60 has a diameter of 120,000 light-years and is as massive as one trillion suns. At its center lies a huge black hole, 4.5 billion times as massive as the sun — one of the most massive black holes ever found.  In this stunning image, which includes observations taken in infrared and visible wavelengths, Hubble has captured M60 (the large, diffuse galaxy at the center) along with the bluish spiral galaxy NGC 4647 (upper right). NGC 4647 is about two-thirds the size of M60 — or roughly the size of the Milky Way galaxy — and is much less massive. The two galaxies form a pair known as Arp 116.  Astronomers have long tried to determine whether these two galaxies are actually interacting. Although from Earth they appear to overlap, there is no evidence of new star formation, which would be one of the clearest signs that the two galaxies are indeed interacting. Discovered by the German astronomer Johann Gottfried Keohler in 1779, M60 is located in the constellation Virgo roughly 54 million light-years from Earth. It has an apparent magnitude of 9.8, and its central region can be seen through a small telescope most easily during May. A larger telescope can reveal NGC 4647 as well.",M105,Galaxy,9.8,7.6,55000000,Virgo,NGC 4649
M61,"Discovered in 1779 by the Italian astronomer Barnaba Oriani, M61 is a barred spiral galaxy located in the constellation Virgo. Charles Messier noticed it on the same night as Oriani, but he mistook the galaxy for a passing comet. A member of the Virgo Cluster of galaxies, M61 is roughly 55 million light-years away from Earth and has an apparent magnitude of 10.2. It is most easily spotted during the month of May and can be observed using a moderately sized telescope.  M61 is a type of galaxy known as a starburst galaxy. Starburst galaxies experience an incredibly high rate of star formation, hungrily using up their reservoir of gas in a very short period of time (in astronomical terms). But this is not the only activity going on within the galaxy; an X-ray source has been detected deep at its heart, leading astronomers to believe that a supermassive black hole sits at its core. This galaxy has also been host to seven observed supernovas — the most of any galaxy in the Messier catalog.  This Hubble image of M61, created from observations at visible and infrared wavelengths, grants a close look at the face-on galaxy’s structure. The spiral arms can be seen in stunning detail, swirling inward to the very center of the galaxy, where they form a smaller, intensely bright spiral. In the outer regions, these vast arms are sprinkled with bright, blue regions where new stars are being formed from hot, dense clouds of gas.  The image’s stair-step appearance results from the design of the camera used to take the exposures. The camera consisted of four light detectors, one of which provided a higher resolution but had a smaller field of view than the other three. Because the detector with the higher resolution did not cover as much area as the others, black regions were left when the images from all four detectors were combined into one picture. ",M61,Galaxy,10.1,6.5,52500000,Virgo,NGC 4303
M62,"M62 is known for being one of the most irregularly shaped globular clusters in our galaxy. This might be because it is one of the closest globular clusters to the center of our galaxy and is affected by galactic tidal forces, displacing many of the cluster’s stars toward the southeast.  M62 has an extremely dense core of 150,000 stars. In 2013, astronomers discovered a stellar-mass black hole in M62, one of the first to ever be found in a globular cluster. According to observations from NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory, M62 also contains a large number of X-ray binaries, which formed in close encounters between stars in the cluster.  This Hubble observation was taken in ultraviolet and visible light using the Advanced Camera for Surveys and Wide Field Camera 3. Most of the globular cluster is featured in this observation, with the core focused toward the top right. Hubble made these observations to help astronomers study the characteristics of globular clusters, measure the mass of M62’s black hole, and help determine the formation and evolution of cluster binaries.  Charles Messier discovered M62 in 1771. The globular cluster is almost 12 billion years old. M62 has a magnitude of 6.6 and is located in the constellation Ophiuchus, approximately 22,200 light-years away from Earth. Best observed in July, the cluster is easily found southeast of the bright star Antares and can be seen as a hazy patch with binoculars. Small telescopes reveal a comet-like shape, while telescopes 8 inches or larger will resolve more stars.",M5,Globular Cluster,6.5,14.1,22200000,Ophiuchus,NGC 6266
M63,"Star formation is one of the most important processes in shaping the universe. In addition to birthing new stars, it gives rise to planetary systems and plays a pivotal role in the evolution of galaxies. Yet there is still much that astronomers do not understand about this fundamental process. The driving force behind star formation is particularly unclear for a type of galaxy called a flocculent spiral. Unlike grand-design spiral galaxies, flocculent spiral galaxies do not have well defined spiral arms. Instead, they appear to have many discontinuous arms.  M63, also known as the Sunflower galaxy, is one such flocculent spiral galaxy. Although it only has two arms, many appear to be winding around its yellow core in this image captured by Hubble. The arms shine with the radiation from recently formed blue stars and can be more clearly seen in infrared observations. By imaging flocculent spiral galaxies like M63, astronomers hope to gain a better understanding of how stars form in such systems.  The Sunflower galaxy was discovered in 1779 by the French astronomer Pierre Méchain and was the first of 24 objects that Méchain would contribute to Charles Messier’s catalog. The galaxy is located roughly 27 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Canes Venatici. It has an apparent magnitude of 9.3 and appears as a faint patch of light in small telescopes. The best time to observe M63 is during May. ",M63,Galaxy,9.3,12.6,37000000,Canes Venatici,NGC 5055
M64,"Easily identified by the spectacular band of absorbing dust partially obscuring its bright nucleus, M64, or the Black Eye galaxy, is characterized by its bizarre internal motion. The gas in the outer regions of this remarkable galaxy is rotating in the opposite direction from the gas and stars in its inner regions. This strange behavior can be attributed to a merger between M64 and a satellite galaxy over a billion years ago. New stars are forming in the region where the oppositely rotating gases collide, are compressed, and then contract. M64 was discovered by the English astronomer Edward Pigott. It is located 17 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Coma Berenices and is best observed in May. With an apparent magnitude of 9.8, the Black Eye galaxy can be spotted with a moderately sized telescope.",M63,Galaxy,9.3,10.3,24000000,Coma Berenices,NGC 4826
M65,"M65 is a spiral galaxy with an apparent magnitude of 10.3. Charles Messier discovered it and its neighbor M66 on the same night in 1780. Located roughly 35 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Leo, M65 is a member of the Leo Triplet of galaxies. It can be spotted with a small telescope in the same field of view as the other members of the triplet (M66 and NGC 3628). The best time to observe M65 is in April.  This image of M65’s center is a composite created using exposures taken with Hubble at both visible and infrared wavelengths. Its stair-step appearance results from the design of the camera used to take the exposures. The camera consisted of four light detectors, one of which provided a higher resolution but had a smaller field of view than the other three. Because the detector with the higher resolution did not cover as much area as the others, black regions remain when the images from all four detectors are combined into one picture.",M65,Galaxy,10.1,9,35000000,Leo,NGC 3623
M66,"In 1780, Charles Messier discovered spiral galaxy M66 along with its neighbor M65, both of which belong to the Leo Triplet of galaxies. (The third member, NGC 3628, was discovered by William Herschel in 1784 and is not included in the Messier catalog). M66 is located 35 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Leo and has an apparent magnitude of 8.9. Best observed during April, M66 can be spotted with a small telescope. Because the galaxies in the Leo Triplet interact with one another, each has an effect on its neighbors’ structures. M66 displays asymmetric spiral arms and a core that appears to be off center — features likely caused by the gravitational pull of the other two galaxies in the Leo Triplet.",M63,Galaxy,9.7,9.1,36000000,Leo,NGC 3627
M67,"Messier 67 (M67), nicknamed the King Cobra Cluster, is an open cluster located in the northern constellation Cancer, the Crab.

Messier 67 can be found roughly halfway and slightly above the imaginary line connecting the bright stars Regulus in Leo and Procyon in Canis Minor. With an apparent diameter of 30 arc minutes, M67 appears roughly the same size as the full Moon.

M68,"Discovered by Charles Messier in 1780, M68 is a dense collection of stars known as a globular cluster. Mutual gravitational attraction amongst the hundreds of thousands or even millions of stars in such a cluster keeps stellar members packed tightly together for many billions of years.  Roughly 150 of these objects reside in our Milky Way galaxy. On a galactic scale, globular clusters are relatively small. In M68’s case, its constituent stars span a volume of space with a diameter of little more than a hundred light-years. The disk of the Milky Way, on the other hand, extends over 100,000 light-years.

The cluster is best observed during April.",M5,Globular Cluster,7.8,9.8,33600,Hydra,NGC 4590
M69,"M69 is one of the most metal-rich globular clusters ever observed. In astronomy, the term “metal” refers to any element heavier than the two most common elements in our universe, hydrogen and helium. The nuclear fusion that powers stars created many of the metallic elements in nature, from the calcium in our bones to the carbon in diamonds. New stars are made from the remains of their predecessors, so ancient globular clusters have much lower metallic abundances than more recently formed stars, such as the sun.  The stars in M69 have over ten times more iron than stars in other globular clusters of the same age. Studying the makeup of stars in globular clusters like M69 has helped astronomers trace back the evolution of star formation in the cosmos.  This cluster was discovered by Charles Messier in 1780. It is located 29,700 light-years away from Earth in the constellation Sagittarius. M69 has an apparent magnitude of 8.3 and can be spotted with a pair of binoculars most easily in August.",M5,Globular Cluster,7.6,7.1,29700,Sagittarius,NGC 6637
M70,"Quarters are always tight in globular clusters, where the mutual hold of gravity binds together hundreds of thousands of stars in a small region of space. M70 is particularly fascinating because it has undergone what is known as a core collapse. This means that even more stars squeeze into the object’s core than in an average globular cluster.  The legions of stars in a globular cluster orbit about a shared center of gravity. Some stars maintain relatively circular orbits, while others loop out into the cluster’s fringes. As the stars interact with each other over time, lighter stars tend to pick up speed and migrate out toward the cluster’s edges, while the heavier stars are slower and congregate toward the center. This huddling effect produces the characteristically dense center of core-collapsed clusters. About a fifth of the roughly 150 globular clusters in the Milky Way have undergone a core collapse.  M70 was discovered by Charles Messier in 1780. It is located 30,000 light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius. With an apparent magnitude of 9.1, the cluster can be observed through a small telescope best in the month of August.",M5,Globular Cluster,7.9,7.8,29400,Sagittarius,NGC 6681
M71,"Ever since it was discovered in 1746 by the Swiss astronomer Jean-Philippe Loys de Chéseaux, the nature of M71 has been the subject of some questioning. Over the centuries, it has been classified as both an abnormally dense open star cluster and as an unusually loose globular cluster.  Because M71 does not seem to have a high concentration of stars at its center, and because the elemental composition of the stars it contains suggests that they are younger than most globular clusters, M71 was initially believed to be an open cluster. In the 1970s, astronomers examined the relationship between the brightnesses and temperatures of the stars in the cluster. They found a characteristic trend among the stellar population that is unique to globular clusters, so M71 was reclassified as a young, loosely concentrated globular cluster — one of the smallest of its kind. M71 is located roughly 13,000 light-years from Earth in the constellation Sagitta. It has an apparent magnitude of 6.1 and appears as a faint patch of light with a pair of binoculars.

It was the first of five star clusters that Méchain would discover while assisting Messier and, at a distance of 50,000 light-years from Earth, it is one of the most remote clusters in Messier’s catalog. M72 is located in the constellation Aquarius and has an apparent magnitude of 9.4. The cluster appears as a faint patch of light in small telescopes, and the best time to observe it is during September.

M73,"Messier 73 (M73) is an asterism formed by four physically unrelated stars located in the southern constellation Aquarius.  M73 has an apparent magnitude of 9 and lies at an approximate distance of 2,500 light years from Earth. It has the designation NGC 6994 in the New General Catalogue.  The four stars that form the Y-shaped asterism only appear close to each other in the sky because they are located along the same line of sight when seen from Earth.       The asterism can be found in the southern part of Aquarius constellation, near the border with Capricornus. It is positioned about 1.5 degrees east of the globular cluster Messier 72, and just below the imaginary line connecting the bright stars Fomalhaut in Piscis Austrinus and Altair in Aquila constellation.  M73 can also be found 2 degrees south and 1.5 degrees east of the magnitude 4.5 star Albulaan, Nu Aquarii. As both Aquarius and Capricornus are relatively faint constellations, M72 and M73 are among the more challenging Messier objects to find. The stars of M73 are quite faint and not easy to observe in 10×50 binoculars. Larger binoculars will reveal a dim point of light, while a 4-inch telescope will show the Y shape clearly.

Located in the western part of Sagittarius, M75 has a magnitude of 8.6. The cluster is surprisingly easy to see in binoculars and telescopes thanks to it being extremely condensed in the center.

M76,"This Hubble image features a portion of the Little Dumbbell Nebula, M76. Other names for M76 are the Cork Nebula or Barbell Nebula. M76 was also given two New General Catalog numbers, NGC 650 and NGC 651, because it was formerly suspected to be a double nebula with two components touching each other. In this Hubble observation, only one half of the nebula is shown, so the double-lobed structure isn’t evident.  M76 is a planetary nebula, which is an expanding shell of gas around an aging or dying star, and it is one of only four planetary nebulas in Charles Messier’s catalog. M76 is located in the constellation Perseus and is approximately 2,500 light-years away from Earth.  Hubble made these observations of M76 with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 and the Wide Field Camera 3 in near-infrared and visible light. Most of the image is in visible light, where part of the nebula’s center (shown in green) is located just above the black “steps” in the image. (The “steps” are created by the layout of the detectors of the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2.) Other stars not associated with the nebula appear as red dots throughout the image. The Hubble observations were taken to further understand the distribution and evolutionary states of planetary nebulas.  Discovered in 1780 by Messier’s colleague Pierre Méchain, M76 has an apparent magnitude of 12 and is best viewed in December. While it is possible to spot M76 with large binoculars at a dark site, the nebula’s small size and faintness make it one of the more difficult Messier objects to observe.

The dense heart of the cluster can be spotted as a small, fuzzy patch in binoculars, but observers will need at least a medium-sized telescope to resolve M79’s individual stars and outer environs.  While most globular clusters in our Milky Way galaxy appear around the galactic core in Sagittarius, M79 is one of the few seen on the opposite side of the sky, away from the galaxy’s center. That’s because Earth lies between M79 and the middle of the galaxy. M79 is about 41,000 light-years from us but roughly 60,000 light-years from the galactic center.  M79 is also one of just two globular clusters in the Messier catalog that our galaxy might have stolen from other nearby galaxies in the not-too-distant past. An unusual density of red giant stars in the direction of the constellation Canis Major (not far from M79) could be the remains of a dwarf galaxy that’s currently being shredded and absorbed by our Milky Way galaxy. M79 might have been snatched from this small galaxy, known as the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy. Not surprisingly, the cluster contains many aging red giant stars. However, Hubble has helped show that M79 also includes numerous “blue stragglers,” which are brighter and bluer than astronomers would expect stellar residents of an old globular cluster to be. Astronomers suspect these strange, youthful-looking objects are the products of their compact environments, forming either from stellar mergers or from one star pulling in material from a close neighbor.",M5,Global Cluster,7.7,7.8,41000,Lepus,NGC 1904
M80,"This stellar swarm is M80, one of the densest of the approximately 150 known globular clusters in the Milky Way galaxy. Located about 28,000 light-years from Earth in the constellation Scorpius, the cluster contains hundreds of thousands of stars that are held together by their mutual gravitational attraction. M80 has an apparent magnitude of 7.9 and was discovered by Charles Messier in 1781. It can be spotted with a small telescope most easily during July.  M80 is notable for being the site of a nova in the year 1860. Nova outbursts can occur when a close companion star transfers fresh hydrogen fuel to a burned-out white dwarf. Eventually the hydrogen ignites a thermonuclear explosion on the surface of the white dwarf, giving rise to the nova outburst. Hubble’s ultraviolet observations of M80 helped astronomers identify the hot, faint remnant of the nova-producing white dwarf.    Hubble’s examination of M80’s core has also revealed a large population of blue stragglers — stars that appear to be unusually young and more massive than the other stars in a globular cluster. M80 contains more than twice as many of these unusual stars than any other globular cluster surveyed by Hubble.",M5,Global Cluster,7.3,5.1,32600,Scorpius,NGC 6093
M81,"Discovered by the German astronomer Johann Elert Bode in 1774, M81 is one of the brightest galaxies in the night sky. It is located 11.6 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Ursa Major and has an apparent magnitude of 6.9. Through a pair of binoculars, the galaxy appears as a faint patch of light in the same field of view as M82. A small telescope will resolve M81’s core. The galaxy is best observed during April. The galaxy’s spiral arms, which wind all the way down into its nucleus, are made up of young, bluish, hot stars formed in the past few million years. They also host a population of stars formed in an episode of star formation that started about 600 million years ago. Ultraviolet light from hot, young stars is fluorescing the surrounding clouds of hydrogen gas. A number of sinuous dust lanes also wind all the way into the nucleus of M81.  The galaxy’s central bulge contains much older, redder stars. It is significantly larger than the Milky Way’s bulge. A black hole of 70 million solar masses resides at the center of M81 and is about 15 times the mass of the Milky Way’s central black hole. Previous Hubble research showed that the size of the black hole in a galaxy’s nucleus is proportional to the mass of the galaxy’s bulge.",M63,Galaxy,7.8,24.9,11800000,Ursa Major,NGC 3031
M82,"M82 or the Cigar galaxy, shines brightly at infrared wavelengths and is remarkable for its star formation activity. The Cigar galaxy experiences gravitational interactions with its galactic neighbor, M81, causing it to have an extraordinarily high rate of star formation — a starburst.  Around the galaxy’s center, young stars are being born 10 times faster than they are inside our entire Milky Way galaxy. Radiation and energetic particles from these newborn stars carve into the surrounding gas, and the resulting galactic wind compresses enough gas to make millions of more stars. The rapid rate of star formation in this galaxy eventually will be self-limiting. When star formation becomes too vigorous, it will consume or destroy the material needed to make more stars. The starburst will then subside, probably in a few tens of millions of years.  M82 was discovered, along with its neighbor M81, by the German astronomer Johann Elert Bode in 1774. Located 12 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Ursa Major, M82 has an apparent magnitude of 8.4 and is best observed in April. Although it is visible as a patch of light with binoculars in the same field of view as M81, larger telescopes are needed in order to resolve the galaxy’s core.  This stunning Hubble image of M82 was assembled using observations at different wavelengths. The red in the image represents hydrogen and infrared light, indicating starburst activity. The blue and greenish-yellow color represent visible wavelengths of light.",M82,Galaxy,9.2,10.5,11500000,Ursa Major,NGC 3034
M83,"This beautiful Hubble image captures hundreds of thousands of individual stars, thousands of star clusters and hundreds of supernova remnants in the spiral galaxy M83. Also known as the Southern Pinwheel, this galaxy is located 15 million light-years away from Earth in the constellation Hydra. It was discovered in 1752 by the French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille. With an apparent magnitude of 7.5, M83 is one of the brightest spiral galaxies in the night sky. It can be observed using a pair of binoculars most easily in May.  Hubble’s image reveals interstellar “bubbles” produced by nearly 300 supernovas. By studying these supernova remnants, astronomers can better understand the nature of the stars that exploded and dispersed their nuclear processed chemical elements back into the galaxy, contributing to the next generation of new stars.  The newest generations of stars in M83 are forming largely in clusters on the edges of the dark, spiraling dust lanes. These brilliant, young stellar groupings are only a few million years old and produce huge amounts of ultraviolet light. That light is absorbed by the surrounding diffuse gas clouds, causing them to glow in pinkish hydrogen light.",M83,Galaxy,8,13.1,14700000,Hydra,NGC 5236
M84,"Discovered by Charles Messier in 1781, M84 is an elliptical galaxy located 60 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Virgo. It is one of over a thousand galaxies that make up the Virgo cluster. With an apparent magnitude of 10.1, the galaxy can be spotted using a moderately sized telescope most easily during May.    This image of M84 combines observations taken by Hubble at both visible and infrared wavelengths. Although the image does not show the entire galaxy, it highlights one of M84’s most fascinating features: its central region. Previous Hubble observations of M84 taken with a spectrograph have indicated that the galaxy hosts a supermassive black hole at its core.  M84 is also notable for being the site of two stellar explosions called supernovas, one discovered in 1957 and the other in 1991.",M84,Galaxy,10.2,6.7,60000000,Virgo,NGC 4374
M85,"M85 is either an elliptical or a lenticular galaxy. Lenticular galaxies have qualities of both elliptical and spiral galaxies and are sometimes called armless spirals. M85 is interacting with two neighboring galaxies, the spiral NGC 4394 and the elliptical MCG 3-32-38.  Located in the constellation Coma Berenices, M85 is a member of the Virgo cluster of galaxies and was discovered by Charles Messier’s colleague Pierre Méchain in 1781. It lies approximately 60 million light-years away from Earth and is best seen in May. With an apparent magnitude of 9.2, this galaxy is relatively faint and is not easy to spot with binoculars or small telescopes. In telescopes with 8-inch apertures M85 appears as a dim, elongated patch of light. Larger telescopes will reveal more detail in the galaxy.  About 4 billion to 7 billion years ago, M85 likely merged with another galaxy. M85 contains approximately 400 billion stars, and most of these stars are very old. However, the central region contains relatively young stars, under 3 billion years old, and these stars are thought to have formed in a late burst of star formation activity. The core of M85 may contain a supermassive black hole, and in 2006, astronomers spotted a supernova northeast of the galaxy’s center.",M105,Galaxy,10,7.4,60000000,Coma Berenices,NGC 4382
M86,"Located in the constellation Virgo, M86 is either an elliptical galaxy or a lenticular galaxy (a cross between an elliptical and spiral galaxy). M86 was discovered in 1781 by Charles Messier and is one of the brightest members of the Virgo cluster of galaxies. It contains approximately 3,800 globular clusters.  While the majority of the Virgo cluster is receding from the Milky Way, M86 is getting closer to our galaxy. This is because M86 is located on the far side of the Virgo cluster from us and is moving toward the center of the cluster. Of all the galaxies in Messier’s catalog, M86 is moving the fastest in our direction but is still approximately 52 million light-years away from Earth. The best time of the year to view M86 is during May. Having a magnitude of 9.2, M86 can be seen near fellow galaxies in the Virgo cluster with binoculars and small telescopes, with M84 often appearing alongside M86 in the field of view. Telescopes that are 8 inches or larger will reveal several other, fainter galaxies in the same field of view.",M105,Galaxy,9.9,9.8,52000000,Virgo,NGC 4406
M87,"The elliptical galaxy M87 is the home of several trillion stars, a supermassive black hole and a family of roughly 15,000 globular star clusters. For comparison, our Milky Way galaxy contains only a few hundred billion stars and about 150 globular clusters. The monstrous M87 is the dominant member of the neighboring Virgo cluster of galaxies, which contains some 2,000 galaxies. Discovered in 1781 by Charles Messier, this galaxy is located 54 million light-years away from Earth in the constellation Virgo. It has an apparent magnitude of 9.6 and can be observed using a small telescope most easily in May. Its most striking feature is the blue jet near the center which is a black-hole-powered stream of material that is being ejected from M87’s core. As gaseous material from the center of the galaxy accretes onto the black hole, the energy released produces a stream of subatomic particles that are accelerated to velocities near the speed of light.  At the center of the Virgo cluster, M87 may have accumulated some of its many globular clusters by gravitationally pulling them from nearby dwarf galaxies that seem to be devoid of such clusters today.",M105,Galaxy,9.6,8.7,53500000,Virgo,NGC 4486
M88,"Located approximately 47 million light-years away, M88 is a spiral galaxy with well-defined and symmetrical arms. Although it is a member of the Virgo cluster of galaxies, it appears in the neighboring constellation of Coma Berenices. M88 contains an active galactic nucleus, meaning the central region of the galaxy is more luminous than the rest of the galaxy. At the galaxy’s core resides a supermassive black hole estimated to be 100 million times more massive than our Sun. M88 contains around 400 billion stars and is traveling away from our galaxy.  Charles Messier discovered M88 in 1781 on the same night that he discovered eight other Messier objects. Today, it can be observed with binoculars under clear viewing conditions. Smaller telescopes will reveal an elongated object with a brighter core, while larger telescopes will unveil further details, such as a more defined core. M88 has a magnitude of 9.5 and is best observed in May.  This Hubble observation was taken using the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 with a single visible-light filter. With Hubble, observations in multiple filters are needed to produce color images, so this image is in black and white only. Nearly half of the galaxy is shown in this Hubble view. Hubble took these observations as part of a survey of spiral galaxies to better assess the properties of spiral galaxies, including their galactic cores, their globular cluster populations, and the occurrence of multiple and off-centered nuclei.",M88,Galaxy,10.2,6.8,47000000,Coma Berenices,NGC 4501
M89,"M89 is one of eight galaxies in the Virgo cluster that Charles Messier discovered in 1781. An elliptical galaxy, M89 is almost exactly circular. It is located about 50 million light-years away in the constellation Virgo. M89 contains approximately 100 billion stars and well over 2,000 globular clusters. It was the first galaxy discovered to have an extended envelope, which means that it has a larger region of light surrounding it than other elliptical galaxies, most likely because of its high number of stars and globular clusters. At the center of M89 is a supermassive black hole estimated to have one billion times the mass of our Sun. Telescopes that are 8 inches or larger can see the 9.8-magnitude galaxy as a faint ball of light. The best time to view M89 is in May.",M105,Galaxy,10.9,5.3,50000000,Virgo,NGC 4552
M90,"M90 is a bright, beautiful spiral galaxy situated in the Virgo cluster of galaxies. Located in the constellation Virgo, this galaxy is approximately 59 million light-years away from Earth and has a magnitude of 9.5. M90 is believed to be breaking away from the rest of the galaxies in the Virgo cluster and is one of the few galaxies traveling toward our Milky Way galaxy, not away.  Charles Messier found M90 in 1781 while looking at other galaxies in the Virgo cluster. M90 contains approximately a trillion stars and a thousand globular clusters. With the exception of the inner disk region, the galaxy’s arms contain very little star formation. Interactions with neighboring galaxies likely stripped away the gas and material that M90 needs to have active star formation in its outer regions. In the future, M90 is expected to evolve into a lenticular galaxy, which is a galaxy that has qualities of both a spiral and an elliptical galaxy. The best time to view M90 is in May. It can be seen with binoculars in a clear, dark sky, and telescopes (especially larger ones) will begin to reveal more details of the galaxy, such as its arms and bright core.",M96,Galaxy,10.2,9.9,58700000,Virgo,NGC 4569
M91,"The spiral galaxy M91 was discovered by Charles Messier in 1781. It was the last of the nine objects (M84—M92) that Messier added to his catalog on a single night in March. Located 60 million light-years from Earth with an apparent magnitude of only 11, M91 is one of the faintest objects in Messier’s catalog. It can be spotted with medium-sized telescopes in the constellation Coma Berenices most easily during May.  M91 is one of over a thousand galaxies that make up the Virgo cluster — a group of galaxies that are gravitationally bound to one another. It is an anemic galaxy, meaning that it has a lower rate of star formation compared to other spiral galaxies.  This image is composed of Hubble observations taken in visible and infrared light. It captures a small portion of M91, highlighting the galaxy’s lack of red-colored star-forming regions. These regions of molecular hydrogen are common in other spiral galaxies.",M91,Galaxy,10.9,5.2,63000000,Coma Berenices,NGC 4548
M92,"Located 27,000 light-years from Earth in the constellation Hercules, this globular cluster — a ball of stars that orbits our galaxy’s core like a satellite — was first discovered by the German astronomer Johann Elert Bode in 1777.  With an apparent magnitude of 6.3, M92 is one of the brightest globular clusters in the Milky Way and is visible to the naked eye under good observing conditions. It can be most easily spotted during the month of July. The cluster is very tightly packed with stars, containing roughly 330,000 stars in total.  As is characteristic of ancient globular clusters — of which M92 is one of the oldest — the predominant elements within M92 are hydrogen and helium, with only traces of others, so it belongs to a group of metal-poor clusters. To astronomers, metals are all elements heavier than hydrogen and helium.",M5,Global Cluster,6.4,12.2,26700,Hercules,NGC 6341
M93,"Messier 93 (M93) is an open star cluster located in the constellation Puppis. It lies at a distance of 3,600 light years from Earth.  Messier 93 has the designation NGC 2447 in the New General Catalogue. The cluster has an apparent diameter of 22 arc minutes, roughly two thirds the size of the full Moon. This corresponds to a spatial extension of about 20 to 25 light years.  M93 can be seen without binoculars under exceptionally clear, dark skies, and is easy to find with binoculars. It has an apparent magnitude of 6.0.       Binoculars and small telescopes reveal the triangular shape formed by the cluster’s brightest stars. Small telescopes show a large, dense star cluster with a grouping of stars shaped like an arrowhead near the centre. 8-inch and larger telescopes resolve dozens of stars in the cluster.  Messier 93 is not very hard to find as it is located in the same area of the sky as Sirius, the brightest star in the sky.",M93,Open Cluster,6.2,22,3600,Puppis,NGC 2447
M94,"M94 is a spiral galaxy located 16 million light-years away in the constellation Canes Venatici. It was discovered in 1781 by Pierre Méchain, a French astronomer for whom an asteroid was named in 2002. The galaxy has an apparent magnitude of 9 and can be spotted through a small telescope. The best time of year to observe M94 is during May. New stars are forming at a high rate within the bright ring. This region is known as a starburst ring. The cause of this peculiarly shaped star-forming region is likely a pressure wave traveling outward from the galactic center, compressing the gas and dust in the outer regions. The compression of material means the gas starts to collapse into denser clouds. Inside these dense clouds, gravity pulls the gas and dust together until the temperature and pressure are high enough for stars to be born.  Although M94 was initially believed to be roughly 30,000 light-years in diameter, two faint spiral arms were recently discovered outside of its core region that extend far out into space. This discovery has effectively tripled the galaxy’s known diameter. M94 is also notable for its deficiency of dark matter relative to other galaxies. Astronomers do not know why it lacks the normal amount of dark matter, but the galaxy has been the subject of extensive study as a result.",M63,Galaxy,8.9,12.3,16000000,Canes Venatici,NGC 4736
M95,"Found in the constellation Leo, M95 is a beautiful barred spiral galaxy. It was discovered in 1781 by Pierre Méchain, a colleague of Charles Messier.  This Hubble observation reveals a section of M95 featuring its central bar of stars in the upper left and one of its spiral arms extending to the lower right. The observations were taken in near-infrared, visible and ultraviolet wavelengths of light with Hubble’s Advanced Camera for Surveys and Wide Field Camera 3. Hubble took these observations of M95 to better understand star formation in nearby galaxies.  M95 is located approximately 33 million light-years away and has a magnitude of 9.7. It has around 40 billion stars. Its spiral arms host a flurry of star birth activity and sparkle with the light of countless young, blue stars. The arms themselves are very tightly wound around the galaxy’s core and are nearly circular.  M95 can be seen as a hazy smudge on a clear, dark night using a good pair of binoculars, but large telescopes will reveal more detail. It appears close to M96, M105 and a number of fainter galaxies that all belong to the Leo I (or M96) group. The best time of the year to view M95 is in April.",M96,Galaxy,10.6,7.3,32600000,Leo,NGC 3351
M96,"In this infrared and visible-light image from Hubble, the spiral galaxy M96 resembles a giant maelstrom of glowing gas, rippled with dark dust that swirls inward toward the nucleus. Its dust and gas are unevenly spread throughout its weak spiral arms, which are asymmetrical because of its gravitational interaction with neighboring galaxies. M96 is also remarkable for the location of its core, which is not exactly at the galactic center.  Because it is gravitationally bound to nearby galaxies, M96 is considered a member of a galaxy group. This collection of galaxies, known as the M96 Group, also includes the bright galaxies M105 and M95, as well as a number of smaller and fainter members. It is the nearest group to Earth containing both bright spirals and a bright elliptical galaxy.  M96 was discovered in 1781 by Pierre Méchain, the French astronomer and cartographer. It is located 35 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Leo. The galaxy has an apparent magnitude of 10.1 and appears very dim in the sky.

The nebula lies at a distance of 2,030 light years from Earth and has an apparent magnitude of 9.9. It has the designation NGC 3587 in the New General Catalogue.  Messier 97 occupies an area 3.4 by 3.3 arc minutes in apparent size, which corresponds to a spatial diameter of 1.82 light years. It was named the Owl Nebula because of its appearance in larger telescopes, which reveal two dark patches that look like the eyes of an owl. These were first sketched by William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse in 1848. The Owl Nebula can be seen in 20×80 binoculars and small telescopes, but only under exceptionally good conditions, and it only appears as a faint ball of light. The owl-like eyes can be seen in 10-inch and larger telescopes.",M97,Planetary Nebula,12,3.23,2600,Ursa Major,NGC 3587
M98,"This image of M98 was taken in 1995 with Hubble’s Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2. Its stair-step pattern results from the design of the camera. These observations were taken in infrared and visible light and feature a portion of the galaxy near the central core. Although it is a member of the Virgo cluster of galaxies, M98 appears in the neighboring constellation of Coma Berenices. Hubble’s observations of M98 were part of an examination of the cores of galaxies in the Virgo cluster.  M98 contains about a trillion stars as well as an abundance of neutral hydrogen gas and interstellar dust. Because of the high amounts of gas and dust, there are numerous star-forming regions in the galaxy, especially in its nucleus and arms. The nucleus itself is “active,” meaning that the center of the galaxy is more luminous than the rest of the galaxy. M98 is located approximately 44 million light-years away and is traveling toward our Milky Way galaxy.  M98 was discovered in 1781 by Pierre Méchain, a colleague of Charles Messier, and is one of the faintest objects in Messier’s catalog. It has a magnitude of 10.1, and observers will need at least a medium-sized telescope to see M98 well.

M99,"M99 is called a grand-design spiral, with long, large and clearly defined spiral arms — giving it a structure somewhat similar to our home galaxy, the Milky Way.  M99 was discovered by the French astronomer Pierre Méchain in 1781. The galaxy is located 55 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Coma Berenices and has an apparent magnitude of 10.4. It can be seen using a moderately sized telescope most easily in May.  A number of unexplained phenomena in M99 have been studied by astronomers. Among these is the nature of PTF 10fqs. What is unusual about PTF 10fqs is that it has so far defied classification. When it was discovered in April 2010, it appeared brighter than a nova (caused by an eruption on a star’s surface) but fainter than a supernova (the explosion that marks the end of life for a large star). Scientists have offered a number of possible explanations, including the intriguing suggestion that the star’s increased brightness could have been caused by a giant planet plunging into its parent star.",M96,Galaxy,10.4,5.3,50200000,Coma Berenices,NGC 4254
M100,"M100 is a stunning example of a grand-design spiral galaxy. M100’s characteristic arms also host several small black holes, including the youngest one ever observed in our cosmic neighborhood.  The galaxy was discovered in 1781 by the French astronomer Pierre Méchain, Charles Messier’s fellow comet hunter who discovered eight comets in his lifetime. M100 is located 56 million light-years away from Earth and appears dim in the night sky. Its apparent magnitude of 10.1 means that, while it can be seen through small telescopes, it will appear only as a faint patch of light. Larger telescopes can resolve more details of this galaxy.

M101,"M101 is also known as the Pinwheel galaxy. The giant spiral disk of stars, dust and gas is 170,000 light-years across — nearly twice the diameter of our galaxy, the Milky Way. M101 is estimated to contain at least one trillion stars. The galaxy’s spiral arms are sprinkled with large regions of star-forming nebulas. These nebulas are areas of intense star formation within giant molecular hydrogen clouds. Brilliant, young clusters of hot, blue, newborn stars trace out the spiral arms.  Pierre Méchain, one of Charles Messier’s colleagues, discovered the Pinwheel galaxy in 1781. Located 25 million light-years away from Earth in the constellation Ursa Major, M101 has an apparent magnitude of 7.9.

M102,"Hubble’s sharp vision reveals a crisp dust lane dividing M102, also known as the Spindle galaxy, into two halves. This edge-on view of M102 highlights the galaxy’s structure: a subtle, reddish bulge surrounding a bright nucleus, a blue disk of stars running parallel to the dust lane, and a transparent outer halo.  M102’s dust lane is slightly warped compared to the disk of starlight. This warp indicates that the galaxy might have experienced gravitational tidal disturbances in the distant past. These disturbances were likely caused by an interaction with a nearby galaxy, as M102 is the largest member of a small cluster of galaxies.  Some faint, wispy trails of dust can be seen meandering away from the disk out into the bulge and inner halo of the galaxy. The outer halo is dotted with numerous globular star clusters, gravitationally bound clusters of nearly a million stars each. Background galaxies that are millions to billions of light-years farther away than M102 are also seen through its halo.  Pierre Méchain, a French astronomer and colleague of Charles Messier, discovered the Spindle galaxy in 1781 — the same year that he discovered the first two of his eight comets. M102 is located 44 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Draco and has an apparent magnitude of 10.7.

M103 occupies an area 6 arc minutes in apparent size, corresponding to a linear diameter of 17.5 light years. It is easy to see, even with binoculars, and appears as a nebulous fan-shaped patch.       4-inch telescopes resolve the four brightest stars in the cluster. Large telescopes resolve more stars across the cluster, but make it harder to make out M103 from the surrounding star field because the cluster is quite loose.

M104,"This stunning Hubble image of M104, also known as the Sombrero galaxy, is one of the largest mosaics ever assembled from Hubble observations. The hallmark of the nearly edge-on galaxy is a brilliant, white, bulbous core encircled by thick dust lanes comprising the spiral structure of the galaxy. This dust lane is the site of star formation in the galaxy. The center of M104 is thought to be home to a massive black hole.  Hubble easily resolves the Sombrero galaxy’s rich system of globular clusters, estimated to be nearly 2,000 in number — 10 times more than the number of globular clusters in our Milky Way galaxy. The ages of the clusters are similar to those in the Milky Way, ranging from 10-13 billion years old. Embedded in the bright core of M104 is a smaller disk (not visible in the image), which is tilted relative to the large disk. X-ray emission suggests that there is material falling into the compact core, where a one-billion-solar-mass black hole resides.  With an apparent magnitude of 8, the Sombrero galaxy is beyond the limit of naked-eye visibility but can be spotted through small telescopes most easily during May. M104 is located 28 million light-years away in the constellation Virgo, and with a mass equal to 800 billion suns, it is one of the most massive objects in the Virgo galaxy cluster.

M105,"M105 is an elliptical galaxy 32 million light-years away in the constellation Leo. It is the largest elliptical in the Messier catalog that is not a member of the Virgo cluster of galaxies. M105 does, however, belong to the M96 (or Leo I) Group, which includes neighbors M95 and M96 as well as several other fainter galaxies. Charles Messier’s colleague Pierre Méchain discovered M105 in 1781 just a few days after locating M95 and M96. Yet M105 was not originally included in Messier’s catalog. It was added in 1947 after astronomer Helen S. Hogg found a letter written by Méchain describing the galaxy.  This Hubble image of M105 was taken in near-infrared and visible light. Like most elliptical galaxies it appears rather featureless and inactive. However, Hubble observations surprised astronomers by revealing young stars and star clusters in M105, indicating that star formation is still taking place in what was thought to be a “dead” galaxy no longer capable of giving birth to new stars. Other Hubble observations measured the speeds of stars moving around the center of the galaxy, which demonstrated that a supermassive black hole resides at M105’s core.  Best observed in April, M105 has an apparent magnitude of 10.2 and can be spotted with a small telescope.

M106,"This magnificent view of the spiral galaxy M106 was assembled from Hubble exposures and ground-based images taken by the amateur astronomer Robert Gendler. Gendler’s ground-based images were used to fill in pieces of the galaxy that Hubble did not observe. The center of the galaxy is composed almost entirely of Hubble observations. The outer spiral arms are also predominantly Hubble data, but were colorized with ground-based images taken by Gendler and fellow amateur astronomer Jay GaBany.  The image reveals one of the most striking features of M106: its extra pair of arms. Most spiral galaxies only have one pair of arms, but M106 has an extra set, seen here as red wisps of gas. Unlike the other arms, these two extra arms are made up of hot gas rather than stars. Astronomers attribute these ghostly arms to the supermassive black hole at the galaxy’s center. The extra arms appear to be an indirect result of the violent churning of matter around the black hole.  M106 was discovered by Charles Messier’s observing assistant, Pierre Méchain, in 1781. It is located 24 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Canes Venatici. Although a larger telescope is needed to resolve detail, M106 has a relatively bright apparent magnitude of 9.1 and can be spotted with a small telescope. It is best observed during May.",M106,Galaxy,9.1,17.4,23700000,Canes Venatici,NGC 4258
M107,"M107 is one of approximately 150 globular star clusters found around the disk of the Milky Way galaxy. These spherical collections each contain hundreds of thousands of extremely old stars and are among the oldest objects in the Milky Way. The origin of globular clusters and their impact on galactic evolution remain somewhat unclear, so astronomers continue to study them through pictures such as this one, obtained by Hubble using visible and infrared observations.  Discovered in 1782 by Pierre Méchain, a French astronomer and colleague of Charles Messier, M107 was the last Messier object to be found. M104 through M109 were all discovered by Méchain and were considered “Méchain objects” until 1947, when they were added to the Messier catalog.  M107 is located 20,000 light-years from Earth in the constellation Ophiuchus. It has an apparent magnitude of 8.9 and can be spotted through a small telescope most easily during July.",M5,Globular Cluster,7.9,3.3,20900,Ophiuchus,NGC 6171
M108,"M108, or the Surfboard galaxy, is located in the constellation Ursa Major approximately 46 million light-years away. It is called the Surfboard galaxy because, when viewed with a telescope, it is seen nearly edge-on with no apparent bulge or pronounced core.  M108 was discovered by Pierre Méchain in 1781 three days after he discovered M97. Charles Messier’s notes state that he observed the galaxy in 1781 but never took an accurate position of it or officially added it to his catalog. M108 was finally added to Messier’s catalog in 1953 by astronomer Owen Gingerich.  There is little evidence of a well-defined spiral pattern in the galaxy, but M108 is classified as a barred spiral galaxy with loosely wound spiral arms. Observations show young star clusters exposed against a mottled and detail-rich background. M108 also contains supershells, which are shells of gas driven by bursts of star formation and resulting supernova explosions. The supershells could also be driven by stellar jets or an infall of gas from outside the galaxy.  At the center of M108 is a supermassive black hole estimated to be 24 million times as massive as the Sun. The Chandra X-ray Observatory discovered multiple X-ray sources in M108, with the brightest X-ray source suspected to be an intermediately sized black hole that is actively accreting material.  M108 is one of the largest and brightest members of the Ursa Major cluster, as well as part of the Virgo supercluster of galaxies. It has a magnitude of 10 and is located just under the bowl of the Big Dipper. M108 can be seen with small telescopes as an elliptical streak of light with a brighter core, while telescopes 8 inches or larger will reveal more detail. The best time to observe M108 is in April, but it can be seen throughout the year for those in the Northern Hemisphere.  This Hubble image was taken using the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 and features only a portion of the galaxy. Its stair-step appearance results from the design of the camera, and because Hubble’s observations were taken in only one filter, it is in black and white. The observations were taken to help astronomers understand various features in the nuclei of nearby disk galaxies.",M108,Galaxy,10.6,8.6,14100000,Ursa Major,NGC 3556
M109,"Messier 109 (M109) is a barred spiral galaxy located in the constellation Ursa Major.  The galaxy lies at a distance of 83.5 million light years and has an apparent magnitude of 10.6. It has the designation NGC 3992 in the New General Catalogue.  Messier 109 occupies an area of 7.6 by 4.7 arc minutes of apparent sky, corresponding to a linear diameter of 180,000 light years. The galaxy can be seen in large binoculars in exceptionally good conditions. Messier 109 contains an estimated 1 trillion stars. It is the brightest member of the M109 Group, a group of 79 galaxies in Ursa Major. It has three known satellite galaxies: UGC 6923, UGC 6940 and UGC 6969.",M109,Galaxy,10.6,7.5,83500000,Ursa Major,NGC 3992
M110,"Located in the constellation Andromeda, M110 was discovered in 1773 by Charles Messier. It is a satellite galaxy of the Andromeda galaxy (M31) and a member of the Local Group, which is made up of the galaxies located closest to the Milky Way (our Milky Way is considered a member of the Local Group as well). M110 is approximately 2,690,000 light-years away from Earth and has a magnitude of 8.  M110 is an elliptical galaxy, which means that it has a smooth and nearly featureless structure. Elliptical galaxies do not have arms or regions of star formation. They are oftentimes considered “dead” compared to spiral galaxies, and the stars in elliptical galaxies are often older than those in other galaxies. However, there is evidence that a population of young blue stars exists at the center of M110. This small elliptical galaxy has approximately 10 billion stars, as well as at least eight globular clusters (the brightest of which can be seen with large telescopes). With a telescope, M110 is fairly easy to spot near the core of the much larger and brighter Andromeda galaxy. Smaller telescopes will only reveal a faint, diffuse patch of light, while larger telescopes will unveil an oval shape with a brighter core. The best time to view M110 is during November.",M105,Galaxy,8.9,19.5,26900000,Andromeda,NGC 205
