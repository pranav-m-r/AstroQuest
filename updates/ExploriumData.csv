The Universe,"Our universe is both ancient and vast, and expanding out farther and faster every day. This accelerating universe, the dark energy that seems to be behind it, and other puzzles like the exact nature of the Big Bang and the early evolution of the universe are among the great puzzles of cosmology. There was a time when scientists thought Earth was at the center of the universe. As late as the 1920s, we did not realize that our galaxy was just one of many in a vast universe.","Our universe is 13.7 billion years old. The widely accepted theory for the origin and evolution of the universe is the Big Bang model, which states that the universe began as an incredibly hot, dense point roughly 13.7 billion years ago. In the 1960s and 1970s, astronomers inferred that there might be more mass in the universe than simply what is visible. By studying the speeds of stars at various locations in galaxies, Vera Rubin noted that there was virtually no difference in the velocities of stars at the center of a galaxy as those farther out. This seemed to go against basic Newtonian physics, which implies that stars on the outskirts of a galaxy would orbit more slowly. The mysterious and invisible mass thought to be causing this phenomenon became known as dark matter. Dark matter is thought to make up 23 percent of the universe, while only 4 percent of the universe is composed of regular matter, such as stars, planets and humans. In the 1920s, astronomer Edwin Hubble made a groundbreaking discovery that the universe is not static, but rather is expanding. In 1998, the Hubble Space Telescope, named for the astronomer, studied distant supernovas and found that the universe was expanding more slowly a long time ago compared with the pace of its expansion today. This discovery puzzled scientists, who long thought that the gravity of matter would gradually slow the universe's expansion, or even cause it to contract. Cosmologists explained this acceleration with something called dark energy, which is thought to be the force pulling the cosmos apart at ever-increasing speeds. Dark energy is thought to make up 73 percent of the universe, but since the elusive energy remains undetected, it remains one of the most compelling topics in cosmology.","Several possibilities for the fate of our universe have been bandied about. They tend to have names such as Big Crunch, Big Rip and Big Freeze that belie their essential bleakness. Ultimately, space could collapse back in on itself, destroying all stars and galaxies in existence, or it could expand into essentially an endless void.The fate of our universe largely depends on a mysterious entity dubbed dark energy. If dark energy continues to exert the same force on the universe in the future, then space will continue to expand, the distance between galaxies stretching wider and wider and at a faster and faster pace. Eventually we won't be able to see anything beyond the Milky Way because everything will be so far away. This scenario is sometimes called the Big Freeze, because the universe will end up largely cold, dark and empty. If dark energy isn't a constant and instead increases over time, we could be facing what scientists call a Big Rip. The current strength of dark energy is not thought to be enough to overcome gravity on small, local scales. However, if dark energy gets stronger, it may be enough to counteract even that, expanding not just the space between galaxies but the space within them. Another, equally dire possibility is that the strength of dark energy diminishes over time. In that case, the expansion of the universe will stop accelerating and eventually slow down and gravity might ultimately win the tug of war and pull the universe back in on itself. The result would be the Big Crunch.",universe,timeline,crunch,3775
Big Bang,"The broadly accepted theory for the origin and evolution of our universe is the Big Bang model, which states that the universe began as an incredibly hot, dense point roughly 13.7 billion years ago. Cosmologists are unsure what happened before this moment, but with sophisticated space missions, ground-based telescopes and complicated calculations, scientists have been working to paint a clearer picture of the early universe and its formation. A key part of this comes from observations of the cosmic microwave background, which contains the afterglow of light and radiation left over from the Big Bang. This relic of the Big Bang pervades the universe and is visible to microwave detectors, which allows scientists to piece together clues of the early universe.","When the universe was very young, it underwent a burst of expansion, which is known as inflation, where it grew exponentially and doubled in size at least 90 times. After inflation, the universe continued to grow, but at a slower rate. As space expanded, the universe cooled and matter formed. Light chemical elements were created within the first three minutes of the universe's formation. For the first 380,000 years after the Big Bang, however, the intense heat from the universe's creation made it essentially too hot for light to shine. After that, matter cooled enough for electrons to combine with nuclei to form neutral atoms. This phase is known as ""recombination,"" and the absorption of free electrons caused the universe to become transparent. The light that was unleashed at this time is detectable today in the form of radiation from the cosmic microwave background. Yet, the era of recombination was followed by a period of darkness before stars and other bright objects were formed. Roughly 400 million years after the Big Bang, the universe began to come out of its dark ages. During this time, clumps of gas collapsed enough to form the very first stars and galaxies. The emitted ultraviolet light from these energetic events cleared out and destroyed most of the surrounding neutral hydrogen gas. The process of re-ionization, plus the clearing of foggy hydrogen gas, caused the universe to become transparent to ultraviolet light for the first time. Our solar system is estimated to have been born a little after 9 billion years after the Big Bang, making it about 4.6 billion years old.","Basic Newtonian physics implies that stars on the outskirts of a galaxy would orbit more slowly than stars at the center, but scientists found no difference in the velocities of stars farther out. The invisible mass causing this became known as dark matter. Dark matter is thought to make up 23 percent of the universe. In comparison, only 4 percent of the universe is composed of regular matter, which encompasses stars, planets and people. In the 1920s, astronomer Edwin Hubble made a revolutionary discovery about the universe - that the universe is not static, but rather is expanding. Decades later, the prolific space telescope named after him, the Hubble Space Telescope, studied very distant supernovas and found that, a long time ago, the universe was expanding more slowly than it is today. This discovery was surprising because it was long thought that the gravity of matter in the universe would slow its expansion, or even cause it to contract. Dark energy is thought to be the strange force that is pulling the cosmos apart at ever-increasing speeds, but it remains undetected and shrouded in mystery. The existence of this elusive energy, which is thought to make up 73 percent of the universe, is one of the most hotly debated topics in cosmology.",bigbang,universe,timeline,3634
Galaxies,"A galaxy is a huge collection of gas, dust, and billions of stars and their solar systems, all held together by gravity.","Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is typical: it has hundreds of billions of stars, enough gas and dust to make billions more stars, and at least ten times as much dark matter as all the stars and gas put together. And it’s all held together by gravity.  Like more than two-thirds of the known galaxies, the Milky Way has a spiral shape. At the center of the spiral, a lot of energy and, occasionally, vivid flares are being generated. Based on the immense gravity that would be required to explain the movement of stars and the energy expelled, the astronomers conclude that the center of the Milky Way is a supermassive black hole (named Sagittarius A*). Other galaxies have elliptical shapes, and a few have unusual shapes like toothpicks or rings. The Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) shows this diversity. Hubble observed a tiny patch of sky (one-tenth the diameter of the moon) for one million seconds (11.6 days) and found approximately 10,000 galaxies, of all sizes, shapes, and colors. From the ground, we see very little in this spot, which is in the constellation Fornax.","After the Big Bang, the Universe was composed of radiation and subatomic particles. What happened next is up for debate - did small particles slowly team up and gradually form stars, star clusters, and eventually galaxies? Or did the Universe first organize as immense clumps of matter that later subdivided into galaxies? The shapes of galaxies are influenced by their neighbors, and, often, galaxies collide. The Milky Way is itself on a collision course with our nearest neighbor, the Andromeda galaxy. Even though it is the same age as the Milky Way, Hubble observations reveal that the stars in Andromeda's halo are much younger than those in the Milky Way. From this and other evidence, astronomers infer that Andromeda has already smashed into at least one and maybe several other galaxies.",m83,m63,m104,1990
Star Birth,"Stars are the most widely recognized astronomical objects, and represent the most fundamental building blocks of galaxies. The age, distribution, and composition of the stars in a galaxy trace the history, dynamics, and evolution of that galaxy. Moreover, stars are responsible for the manufacture and distribution of heavy elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, and their characteristics are intimately tied to the characteristics of the planetary systems that may coalesce about them. Consequently, the study of the birth, life, and death of stars is central to the field of astronomy.","Stars are born within the clouds of dust and scattered throughout most galaxies. A familiar example of such as a dust cloud is the Orion Nebula. Turbulence deep within these clouds gives rise to knots with sufficient mass that the gas and dust can begin to collapse under its own gravitational attraction. As the cloud collapses, the material at the center begins to heat up. Known as a protostar, it is this hot core at the heart of the collapsing cloud that will one day become a star. Three-dimensional computer models of star formation predict that the spinning clouds of collapsing gas and dust may break up into two or three blobs; this would explain why the majority the stars in the Milky Way are paired or in groups of multiple stars. As the cloud collapses, a dense, hot core forms and begins gathering dust and gas. Not all of this material ends up as part of a star — the remaining dust can become planets, asteroids, or comets or may remain as dust.","A star the size of our Sun requires about 50 million years to mature from the beginning of the collapse to adulthood. Our Sun will stay in this mature phase (on the main sequence as shown in the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram) for approximately 10 billion years.  Stars are fueled by the nuclear fusion of hydrogen to form helium deep in their interiors. The outflow of energy from the central regions of the star provides the pressure necessary to keep the star from collapsing under its own weight, and the energy by which it shines.  As shown in the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram, Main Sequence stars span a wide range of luminosities and colors, and can be classified according to those characteristics. The smallest stars, known as red dwarfs, may contain as little as 10% the mass of the Sun and emit only 0.01% as much energy, glowing feebly at temperatures between 3000-4000K. Despite their diminutive nature, red dwarfs are by far the most numerous stars in the Universe and have lifespans of tens of billions of years.  On the other hand, the most massive stars, known as hypergiants, may be 100 or more times more massive than the Sun, and have surface temperatures of more than 30,000 K. Hypergiants emit hundreds of thousands of times more energy than the Sun, but have lifetimes of only a few million years. Although extreme stars such as these are believed to have been common in the early Universe, today they are extremely rare - the entire Milky Way galaxy contains only a handful of hypergiants.",m8,m16,yellowmainseq,3066
Nebulae,"A nebula is a giant cloud of dust and gas in space. Some nebulae (more than one nebula) come from the gas and dust thrown out by the explosion of a dying star, such as a supernova. Other nebulae are regions where new stars are beginning to form. For this reason, some nebulae are called ""star nurseries."" Nebulae are made of dust and gases—mostly hydrogen and helium. The dust and gases in a nebula are very spread out, but gravity can slowly begin to pull together clumps of dust and gas. As these clumps get bigger and bigger, their gravity gets stronger and stronger.  Eventually, the clump of dust and gas gets so big that it collapses from its own gravity. The collapse causes the material at the center of the cloud to heat up-and this hot core is the beginning of a star. Nebulae exist in the space between the stars—also known as interstellar space. The closest known nebula to Earth is called the Helix Nebula, which is approximately 700 light-years away from Earth.","There are many different types of nebulae and they are classified as being emission, diffuse, reflective or dark after the way they interact with energy from nearby stars. An emission nebula is a gas cloud of ionised gas or plasma which is emitting light at various wavelengths. The most common source for ionisation comes from high-energy photons emitted by a nearby star. Among the different types of emission nebula are HII regions in which star formation is taking place and young massive stars are the source of the ionising photons. Planetary nebulae consist of a dying star which has thrown off its outer layers, with the exposed hot core then ionising the gas. Due to the prevalence of hydrogen in interstellar gas, and its relatively low energy of ionisation, many emission nebulae appear red due to the strong emissions of the Balmer series. If more energy is available, other elements will be ionised and green and blue nebulae become possible. Most nebulae are about 90% hydrogen, with the remainder helium, oxygen, nitrogen, and other elements. Most nebulae can be described as diffuse, which means that they are extended and contain no well-defined boundaries. A good example is the Pleiades (shown right) where the diffuse nebulae near the stars are examples of reflection nebula. These irregular clouds consist of interstellar matter, gas and dust within which stars can be born.  Dark gas clouds are similar to the diffuse kind, but they are not seen by their emitted or reflected light. Instead, they are seen as dark clouds in front of more distant stars or in front of emission. They are usually very dense and can obscure the light from stars behind them. A good example is the Horsehead Nebula and the Coalsack Nebula.","Reflection nebulae are clouds of dust which reflect the light of a nearby star. The energy from the nearby star is insufficient to ionize the gas to create an emission nebula, but is enough to give sufficient scattering to make the dust visible, thus the frequency spectrum shown by reflection is similar to that of the illuminating stars.  Reflection nebulae are usually blue because the scattering is more efficient for blue light than red. Planetary nebulae form from the gaseous shells that are ejected from low-mass giant stars when they reach the end of their lives and transform into white dwarfs. These are emission nebulae with spectral emission that is similar to that found in star formation regions. A supernova occurs when a high mass star reaches the end of its life. When this happens, the star sheds its outer layers as a superheated cloud of ionised gas. Much of the optical and X-ray emissions originate from the ionised gas, but a substantial amount of the radio emission is a form of non-thermal emission called synchrotron emission which originates within the magnetic field.",m43,m57,nebula,3811
Star Clusters,"A star cluster is a group of stars that share a common origin and are gravitationally bound for some length of time. They are are particularly useful to astronomers as they provide a way to study and model stellar evolution and ages. The two basic categories of stellar clusters are open clusters, also known as galactic clusters, and globular clusters.","Open clusters are so-named due to the fact that the individual component stars are easily resolved through a telescope. Some examples such as the Hyades and Pleiades are so close that the individual stars can be clearly distinguished by the naked eye. They are sometimes called galactic clusters due to their location on the dusty spiral arms on the plane of spiral galaxies. Stars in an open cluster have a common origin - they formed from the same initial giant molecular cloud. Clusters typically contain a few hundred stars though this can vary from as low as a few dozen up to a few thousand. The Jewel Box cluster, one of the best southern sky open clusters to observe with a small telescope. It is located near the star κ Crucis in Crux. Stars within an open cluster are only loosely bound by gravity. As the cluster rotates around the galaxy it eventually disperses due to gravitational perturbations with other other objects in the galaxy. Whilst our Sun is likely to have initially formed in an open cluster there is now no discernable clustering with nearby stars. Open clusters are therefore usually relatively young objects. Some, such as the Pleiades still show evidence of nebulosity suggesting their recent formation. Open cluster stars belong to Population I, they are young and have high metallicities. Clusters range from a couple to 20 or so parsecs across. Globular clusters contain several thousand to one million stars in spherical, gravitationally-bound system. Located mostly in the halo surrounding the galactic plane they comprise the oldest stars in the galaxy. These Population II stars are highly evolved but with low metallicities. Clusters are so old that any star higher than a G or F-class will have already evolved off the main sequence. There is little free dust or gas found in globular clusters so no new star formation is taking place in them. Stellar densities within the inner regions of a globular cluster are very high compared with regions such as those around the Sun. As with open clusters, stars in globular clusters probably had a common origin. Unlike open clusters, globular clusters normally remain gravitationally coherent throughout their lives. The stars within them are not dispersed out of the cluster. Our Milky Way has about 200 globular clusters.","Star clusters are particularly important because they allow astronomers to check models of stellar evolution and the ages of stars. Stars in an open cluster have a common origin from a given nebula. They therefore share the same initial metallicity so any effect of this on stellar evolution is effectively the same for the members of the cluster. Another important point is that all stars within a cluster are effectively at the same distance form an observer on Earth. Even though a cluster may be a few parsecs across this size is insignificant compared with the much greater distance of the cluster from Earth. If we take photometric readings for the cluster stars, the apparent magnitude of each thus also allows us to infer the relative absolute luminosities of the cluster members. The stars that appear brightest within a cluster are intrinsically more luminous than fainter members. Astronomers use this fact to obtain a colour-magnitude diagram for a cluster and obtain the values of absolute magnitude.",m45,m35,m14,3671
Star Death,"In general, the larger a star, the shorter its life, although all but the most massive stars live for billions of years. When a star has fused all the hydrogen in its core, the core begins to collapse into itself and becomes much hotter. If the star is sufficiently massive, the collapsing core may become hot enough to support more exotic nuclear reactions that consume helium and produce a variety of heavier elements up to iron. Gradually, the star's internal nuclear fires become increasingly unstable. These variations cause the star to pulsate and throw off its outer layers, enshrouding itself in a cocoon of gas and dust. What happens next depends on the size of the core.","For average stars like the Sun, the process of ejecting its outer layers continues until the stellar core is exposed. This dead, but still ferociously hot stellar cinder is called a White Dwarf. Pressure from fast moving electrons keeps these stars from collapsing. This fate awaits only those stars with a mass up to about 1.4 times the mass of our Sun. If a white dwarf forms in a binary or multiple star system, its gravity may drag matter from the outer layers of that star onto itself, building up its surface layer. When enough hydrogen has accumulated on the surface, a burst of nuclear fusion occurs, causing the white dwarf to brighten substantially and expel the remaining material. Within a few days, the glow subsides and the cycle starts again. Sometimes, particularly massive white dwarfs may accrete so much mass in the manner that they collapse and explode completely, becoming what is known as a supernova. Main sequence stars over eight solar masses are destined to die in a titanic explosion called a supernova. In massive stars, a complex series of nuclear reactions leads to the production of iron in the core. Fusion reactions that form elements heavier than iron actually consume energy rather than produce it and hence the star no longer has any way to support its own mass. In just a matter of seconds the core shrinks from roughly 5000 miles across to just a dozen, and the temperature spikes 100 billion degrees or more. The outer layers of the star initially begin to collapse along with the core, but rebound with the enormous release of energy and are thrown violently outward. For a period of days to weeks, a supernova may outshine an entire galaxy. On average, a supernova explosion occurs about once every hundred years in the typical galaxy. If the collapsing stellar core at the center of a supernova contains between about 1.4 and 3 solar masses, the collapse continues until electrons and protons combine to form neutrons, producing a neutron star. Neutron stars are incredibly dense - similar to the density of an atomic nucleus. Neutron stars also have powerful magnetic fields which can accelerate atomic particles around its magnetic poles producing powerful beams of radiation. If the collapsed stellar core is larger than three solar masses, it collapses completely to form a black hole: an infinitely dense object whose gravity is so strong that nothing can escape its immediate proximity, not even light. Since photons are what our instruments are designed to see, black holes can only be detected indirectly. Indirect observations are possible because as matter spirals into a black hole, it forms a disk that is heated to enormous temperatures, emitting copious quantities of X-rays and Gamma-rays.","The dust and debris left behind by novae and supernovae eventually blend with the surrounding interstellar gas and dust, enriching it with the heavy elements and chemical compounds produced during stellar death. Eventually, those materials are recycled, providing the building blocks for a new generation of stars and accompanying planetary systems.",m1,bluesupergiant,m82,3775
Black Holes,"Black holes are some of the strangest and most fascinating objects in outer space. They're extremely dense, with such strong gravitational attraction that even light cannot escape their grasp if it comes near enough.  Albert Einstein first predicted the existence of black holes in 1916, with his general theory of relativity. The term ""black hole"" was coined many years later in 1967 by American astronomer John Wheeler. After decades of black holes being known only as theoretical objects, the first physical black hole ever discovered was spotted in 1971. Then, in 2019 the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration released the first image ever recorded of a black hole. So far, astronomers have identified three types of black holes: stellar black holes, supermassive black holes and intermediate black holes.","When a star burns through the last of its fuel, the object may collapse, or fall into itself. For smaller stars, the new core will become a neutron star or a white dwarf. But when a larger star collapses, it continues to compress and creates a stellar black hole. Black holes formed by the collapse of individual stars are relatively small, but incredibly dense. One of these objects packs more than three times the mass of the sun into the diameter of a city. This leads to a crazy amount of gravitational force pulling on objects around the object. Stellar black holes then consume the dust and gas from their surrounding galaxies, which keeps them growing in size. Small black holes populate the universe, but their cousins, supermassive black holes, dominate. These enormous black holes are millions or even billions of times as massive as the sun, but are about the same size in diameter. Such black holes are thought to lie at the center of pretty much every galaxy, including the Milky Way. Once these giants have formed, they gather mass from the dust and gas around them, material that is plentiful in the center of galaxies, allowing them to grow to even more enormous sizes. Supermassive black holes may be the result of hundreds or thousands of tiny black holes that merge together. Large gas clouds could also be responsible, collapsing together and rapidly accreting mass. A third option is the collapse of a stellar cluster, a group of stars all falling together. Fourth, supermassive black holes could arise from large clusters of dark matter. This is a substance that we can observe through its gravitational effect on other objects; however, we don't know what dark matter is composed of because it does not emit light and cannot be directly observed.","Black holes have three ""layers"": the outer and inner event horizon, and the singularity.  The event horizon of a black hole is the boundary around the mouth of the black hole, past which light cannot escape. Once a particle crosses the event horizon, it cannot leave. Gravity is constant across the event horizon.  The inner region of a black hole, where the object's mass lies, is known as its singularity, the single point in space-time where the mass of the black hole is concentrated.  Scientists can't see black holes the way they can see stars and other objects in space. Instead, astronomers must rely on detecting the radiation black holes emit as dust and gas are drawn into the dense creatures. But supermassive black holes, lying in the center of a galaxy, may become shrouded by the thick dust and gas around them, which can block the telltale emissions.  Sometimes, as matter is drawn toward a black hole, it ricochets off the event horizon and is hurled outward, rather than being tugged into the maw. Bright jets of material traveling at near-relativistic speeds are created. Although the black hole remains unseen, these powerful jets can be viewed from great distances.",bh2,bhreal,bh,3771
Neutron Stars,"Neutron stars are formed when a massive star runs out of fuel and collapses. The very central region of the star – the core – collapses, crushing together every proton and electron into a neutron. If the core of the collapsing star is between about 1 and 3 solar masses, these newly-created neutrons can stop the collapse, leaving behind a neutron star. (Stars with higher masses will continue to collapse into stellar-mass black holes.)  This collapse leaves behind the most dense object known – an object with the mass of a sun squished down to the size of a city. These stellar remnants measure about 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) across. One sugar cube of neutron star material would weigh about 1 trillion kilograms (or 1 billion tons) on Earth – about as much as a mountain.  Since neutron stars began their existence as stars, they are found scattered throughout the galaxy in the same places where we find stars. And like stars, they can be found by themselves or in binary systems with a companion. Many neutron stars are likely undetectable because they simply do not emit enough radiation. However, under certain conditions, they can be easily observed. A handful of neutron stars have been found sitting at the centers of supernova remnants quietly emitting X-rays. More often, though, neutron stars are found spinning wildly with extreme magnetic fields as pulsars or magnetars. In binary systems, some neutron stars can be found accreting materials from their companions, emitting electromagnetic radiation powered by the gravitational energy of the accreting material. Below we introduce two general classes of non-quiet neutron star – pulsars and magnetars.","Most neutron stars are observed as pulsars. Pulsars are rotating neutron stars observed to have pulses of radiation at very regular intervals that typically range from milliseconds to seconds. Pulsars have very strong magnetic fields which funnel jets of particles out along the two magnetic poles. These accelerated particles produce very powerful beams of light. Often, the magnetic field is not aligned with the spin axis, so those beams of particles and light are swept around as the star rotates. When the beam crosses our line-of-sight, we see a pulse – in other words, we see pulsars turn on and off as the beam sweeps over Earth.  One way to think of a pulsar is like a lighthouse. At night, a lighthouse emits a beam of light that sweeps across the sky. Even though the light is constantly shining, you only see the beam when it is pointing directly in your direction. The video below is an animation of a neutron star showing the magnetic field rotating with the star. Partway through, the point-of-view changes so that we can see the beams of light sweeping across our line of sight – this is how a pulsar pulses.","Another type of neutron star is called a magnetar. In a typical neutron star, the magnetic field is trillions of times that of the Earth's magnetic field; however, in a magnetar, the magnetic field is another 1000 times stronger.  In all neutron stars, the crust of the star is locked together with the magnetic field so that any change in one affects the other. The crust is under an immense amount of strain, and a small movement of the crust can be explosive. But since the crust and magnetic field are tied, that explosion ripples through the magnetic field. In a magnetar, with its huge magnetic field, movements in the crust cause the neutron star to release a vast amount of energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation. A magnetar called SGR 1806-20 had a burst where in one-tenth of a second it released more energy than the sun has emitted in the last 100,000 years!",neutronstar,pulsar,magnetar,3673
The Sun,"The Sun is a yellow dwarf star, a hot ball of glowing gases at the heart of our solar system. Its gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything – from the biggest planets to the smallest particles of debris – in its orbit. The connection and interactions between the Sun and Earth drive the seasons, ocean currents, weather, climate, radiation belts and auroras. Though it is special to us, there are billions of stars like our Sun scattered across the Milky Way galaxy.","With a radius of 432,168.6 miles (695,508 kilometers), our Sun is not an especially large star—many are several times bigger—but it is still far more massive than our home planet: 332,946 Earths match the mass of the Sun. The Sun’s volume would need 1.3 million Earths to fill it. The Sun is 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from Earth. Its nearest stellar neighbor is the Alpha Centauri triple star system: Proxima Centauri is 4.24 light years away, and Alpha Centauri A and B—two stars orbiting each other—are 4.37 light years away. The Sun, and everything that orbits it, is located in the Milky Way galaxy. More specifically, our Sun is in a spiral arm called the Orion Spur that extends outward from the Sagittarius arm. From there, the Sun orbits the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, bringing the planets, asteroids, comets and other objects along with it. Our solar system is moving with an average velocity of 450,000 miles per hour (720,000 kilometers per hour). But even at this speed, it takes us about 230 million years to make one complete orbit around the Milky Way. The Sun and the rest of the solar system formed from a giant, rotating cloud of gas and dust called a solar nebula about 4.5 billion years ago. As the nebula collapsed because of its overwhelming gravity, it spun faster and flattened into a disk. Most of the material was pulled toward the center to form our Sun, which accounts for 99.8% of the mass of the entire solar system. Like all stars, the Sun will someday run out of energy. When the Sun starts to die, it will swell so big that it will engulf Mercury and Venus and maybe even Earth. Scientists predict the Sun is a little less than halfway through its lifetime and will last another 6.5 billion years before it shrinks down to be a white dwarf. ","The Sun, like others stars, is a ball of gas. In terms of the number of atoms, it is made of 91.0% hydrogen and 8.9% helium. By mass, the Sun is about 70.6% hydrogen and 27.4% helium. The Sun's enormous mass is held together by gravitational attraction, producing immense pressure and temperature at its core. The Sun has six regions: the core, the radiative zone, and the convective zone in the interior; the visible surface, called the photosphere; the chromosphere; and the outermost region, the corona.  At the core, the temperature is about 27 million degrees Fahrenheit (15 million degrees Celsius), which is sufficient to sustain thermonuclear fusion. This is a process in which atoms combine to form larger atoms and in the process release staggering amounts of energy. Specifically, in the Sun’s core, hydrogen atoms fuse to make helium. The Sun itself is not a good place for living things, with its hot, energetic mix of gases and plasma. But the Sun has made life on Earth possible, providing warmth as well as energy that organisms like plants use to form the basis of many food chains.",redgiant,sun,sunparts,3378
The Earth,"Earth, our home, is the third planet from the sun. It's the only planet known to have an atmosphere containing free oxygen, oceans of water on its surface and, of course, life.  Earth is the fifth largest of the planets in the solar system. It's smaller than the four gas giants — Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune — but larger than the three other rocky planets, Mercury, Mars and Venus.  Earth has a diameter of roughly 8,000 miles (13,000 kilometers) and is round because gravity pulls matter into a ball. But, it's not perfectly round. Earth is really an ""oblate spheroid,"" because its spin causes it to be squashed at its poles and swollen at the equator.  Water covers roughly 71 percent of Earth's surface, and most of that is in the oceans. About a fifth of Earth's atmosphere consists of oxygen, produced by plants. While scientists have been studying our planet for centuries, much has been learned in recent decades by studying pictures of Earth from space.","While Earth orbits the sun, the planet is simultaneously spinning on an imaginary line called an axis that runs from the North Pole to the South Pole. It takes Earth 23.934 hours to complete a rotation on its axis and 365.26 days to complete an orbit around the sun.  Earth's axis of rotation is tilted in relation to the ecliptic plane, an imaginary surface through the planet's orbit around the sun. This means the Northern and Southern hemispheres will sometimes point toward or away from the sun depending on the time of year, and this changes the amount of light the hemispheres receive, resulting in the seasons.  Earth's orbit is not a perfect circle, but rather an oval-shaped ellipse, similar to the orbits of all the other planets. Our planet is a bit closer to the sun in early January and farther away in July, although this variation has a much smaller effect than the heating and cooling caused by the tilt of Earth's axis. Earth happens to lie within the so-called ""Goldilocks zone"" around the sun, where temperatures are just right to maintain liquid water on our planet's surface.","Scientists think Earth was formed at roughly the same time as the sun and other planets some 4.6 billion years ago. Earth's core is about 7,100 km wide, slightly larger than half the Earth's diameter. The outermost 2,250 km of the core are liquid, while the inner core is solid. The core is responsible for the planet's magnetic field, which helps to deflect harmful charged particles shot from the sun.  Above the core is Earth's mantle, which is about 2,900 km thick. The mantle is not completely stiff but can flow slowly. Earth's crust floats on the mantle much as a piece of wood floats on water. The slow motion of rock in the mantle shuffles continents around and causes earthquakes, volcanoes and the formation of mountain ranges. Above the mantle, Earth has two kinds of crust. The dry land of the continents consists mostly of granite and other light silicate minerals, while the ocean floors are made up mostly of a dark, dense volcanic rock called basalt. Continental crust averages 40 km thick while the Oceanic crust is usually only about 8 km thick. Earth's atmosphere is roughly 78 percent nitrogen and 21 percent oxygen, with trace amounts of water, argon, carbon dioxide and other gases. The lowest layer of the atmosphere is known as the troposphere, which is constantly in motion and why we have weather. Sunlight heats the planet's surface, causing warm air to rise into the troposphere. This air expands and cools as air pressure decreases, and because this cool air is denser than its surroundings, it then sinks and gets warmed by the Earth again. These favourable conditions are responsible for the existence of such a variety of life on the planet.",earthimg,earth,life,3741
The Moon,"The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. At about one-quarter the diameter of Earth (comparable to the width of Australia), it is the largest natural satellite in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System overall, and is larger than any known dwarf planet. The Moon is a planetary-mass object that formed a differentiated rocky body, making it a satellite planet under geophysical definitions of the term. It lacks any significant atmosphere, hydrosphere, or magnetic field. Its surface gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's (0.1654 g); Jupiter's moon Io is the only satellite in the Solar System known to have a higher surface gravity and density.","Orbiting Earth at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi), or about 30 times Earth's diameter, its gravitational influence slightly lengthens Earth's day and is the main driver of Earth's tides. The Moon's orbit around Earth has a sidereal period of 27.3 days. During each synodic period of 29.5 days, the amount of visible surface illuminated by the Sun varies from none up to 100%, resulting in lunar phases that form the basis for the months of a lunar calendar. The Moon is tidally locked to Earth, which means that the length of a full rotation of the Moon on its own axis causes its same side (the near side) to always face Earth, and the somewhat longer lunar day is the same as the synodic period. That said, 59% of the total lunar surface can be seen from Earth through shifts in perspective due to libration.","The most widely accepted origin explanation posits that the Moon formed about 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth, out of the debris from a giant impact between the planet and a hypothesized Mars-sized body called Theia. It then receded to a wider orbit because of tidal interaction with the Earth. The near side of the Moon is marked by dark volcanic maria (""seas""), which fill the spaces between bright ancient crustal highlands and prominent impact craters. Most of the large impact basins and mare surfaces were in place by the end of the Imbrian period, some three billion years ago. The lunar surface is relatively non-reflective, with a reflectance just slightly brighter than that of worn asphalt. However, because it has a large angular diameter, the full moon is the brightest celestial object in the night sky. The Moon's apparent size is nearly the same as that of the Sun, allowing it to cover the Sun almost completely during a total solar eclipse.",moonimg,moon,le,2506
Transits,A transit is when one object crosses in front of another in space. This can happen in a lot of different ways. One example is when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun. The Moon is “transiting” the Sun. This is also called a solar eclipse.,"But the Moon isn’t the only object that can transit the Sun. We can also see the planet Venus when it passes between Earth and the Sun on its orbit. This is called a transit of Venus.  Because of how the orbits of Venus and the Earth line up, we can’t see the transit of Venus very often. The last transit of Venus was on June 6, 2012, but the next one isn’t until 2117! What about other types of transits? Earth, the Moon and Venus are all in our solar system, and they all transit our Sun. But there are lots of other stars, and many of them have their own planets.  Planets outside our solar system are called exoplanets. If the orbit of a planet is lined up just right, the planet will pass in front of—or transit—the star that it orbits. Looking for transits is one of the ways that scientists find exoplanets. When a transit occurs, the light from the star dims by a very small amount. That dimming can be measured.","The amount of light blocked by the planet tells us how big the planet is compared to its star. The amount of time between each transit tells us about the planet’s orbit. These transits give us a lot of information! If there is more than one exoplanet orbiting the same star, we can tell them apart by their transits. For example, scientists discovered seven exoplanets around a star called TRAPPIST-1. All seven were found by their transits.",transit2,venusimg,transit,1606
Solar Eclipses,"A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon aligns between the Earth and the Sun, casting a shadow on our planet. This celestial event unfolds in distinct stages. Initially, a small portion of the Sun is obscured, creating a noticeable ""bite"" on its edge. As the Moon progresses across the Sun, the sky darkens gradually, and peculiar wavy lines known as Shadow Bands may appear on surfaces due to atmospheric irregularities. This partial phase transitions into a dramatic totality where only a thin crescent of light remains visible. During this stage, Baily's Beads, tiny specks of sunlight filtering through lunar valleys, create a stunning visual effect. The atmosphere darkens further until the Sun's corona, its outermost layer of ionized gases, becomes visible, radiating around the Moon. This corona is typically only observable during a total solar eclipse, offering a rare glimpse into the Sun's outer atmosphere. Additionally, vivid colors from the chromosphere and solar prominences add to the spectacle.","Solar eclipses are classified into three main types: total, partial, and annular, each offering distinct visual phenomena based on the alignment of the Earth, Moon, and Sun. A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon perfectly aligns with the Sun, completely obscuring its bright disk. This alignment allows the Sun's ethereal corona, a halo of plasma extending millions of kilometers into space and reaching temperatures exceeding 2 million degrees Celsius, to become visible. The corona's intricate streamers and loops, shaped by the Sun's magnetic field, shimmer in the darkened sky, providing a rare glimpse into the outermost layers of our star. Surrounding the black silhouette of the Moon during totality, the corona creates a breathtaking sight that captivates observers fortunate enough to witness it. Conversely, an annular eclipse occurs when the Moon is positioned directly between the Earth and the Sun but appears smaller in diameter compared to the Sun. As a result, a bright ring, known as an annulus or ""Ring of Fire,"" surrounds the darkened disk of the Moon. Despite the absence of the corona, annular eclipses still offer a visually striking experience as the Sun appears as a radiant ring against the backdrop of the sky. Partial eclipses occur when the alignment of the Sun, Moon, and Earth is such that only a portion of the Sun is obscured by the Moon. This happens when the three celestial bodies are not perfectly aligned in a straight line, resulting in the Moon casting only a partial shadow on Earth's surface. Partial eclipses are more common than total or annular eclipses and are often visible from a wider geographic area, allowing more people to experience the celestial spectacle, albeit to a lesser extent compared to the dramatic totality or annularity.","Solar eclipses unfold in predictable stages: first contact as the Moon begins to move over the Sun, followed by the partial phases where more of the Sun is covered. Totality, the highlight of the eclipse, marks the moment when the Sun is completely obscured, revealing the corona. After totality, the eclipse enters its final stages as the Moon gradually moves away, allowing more sunlight to reappear until the event concludes. Eclipses are not common occurrences due to the specific alignment required—only during a new moon, when the Moon is on the day-lit side of Earth, can a solar eclipse happen. The duration of totality is brief, typically lasting only a few minutes, despite the entire eclipse event spanning several hours. The next total solar eclipse of exceptional duration is projected for July 16, 2186, illustrating the rarity and significance of these celestial alignments.",se,yellowmainseq,se2,3687
Lunar Eclipses,"Lunar eclipses occur when Earth's shadow blocks the sun's light, which otherwise reflects off the moon. There are three types — total, partial and penumbral — with the most dramatic being a total lunar eclipse, in which Earth's shadow completely covers the moon.","A lunar eclipse can occur only at full moon. A total lunar eclipse can happen only when the sun, Earth and moon are perfectly lined up — anything less than perfection creates a partial lunar eclipse or no eclipse at all. Some understanding of simple celestial mechanics explains how lunar eclipses work. Because the moon's orbit around Earth lies in a slightly different plane than Earth's orbit around the sun, perfect alignment for an eclipse doesn't occur at every full moon. A total lunar eclipse develops over time, typically a couple hours for the whole event. Here's how it works: Earth casts two shadows that fall on the moon during a lunar eclipse: The umbra is a full, dark shadow. The penumbra is a partial outer shadow. The moon passes through these shadows in stages. The initial and final stages — when the moon is in the penumbral shadow — are not so noticeable, so the best part of an eclipse is during the middle of the event, when the moon is in the umbral shadow. According to NASA, two to four solar eclipses occur each year, while lunar eclipses are less frequent. ""In any one calendar year, the maximum number of eclipses is four solar and three lunar,"" the agency said. However, while solar eclipses can only be seen along a roughly 50-mile wide path, each lunar eclipse is visible from over half the Earth. ","Total lunar eclipse: Earth's full (umbral) shadow falls on the moon. The moon won't completely disappear, but it will be cast in an eerie darkness that makes it easy to miss if you were not looking for the eclipse. Some sunlight passing through Earth's atmosphere is scattered and refracted, or bent, and refocused on the moon, giving it a dim glow even during totality. If you were standing on the moon, looking back at the sun, you'd see the black disk of Earth blocking the entire sun, but you'd also see a ring of reflected light glowing around the edges of Earth — that's the light that falls on the moon during a total lunar eclipse.  Partial lunar eclipse: Some eclipses are only partial. But even a total lunar eclipse goes through a partial phase on either side of totality. During the partial phase, the sun, Earth and moon are not quite perfectly aligned, and Earth's shadow appears to take a bite out of the moon.  Advertisement  ""What people see from Earth during a partial lunar eclipse depends on how the sun, Earth and moon are lined up,"" according to NASA.  Penumbral lunar eclipse: This is the least interesting type of eclipse, because the moon is in Earth's faint outer (penumbral) shadow. Unless you're a seasoned skywatcher, you likely won't notice the effect, in which the moon is subtly shaded by Earth's shadow.",le,le2,moonimg,2929
Solar Activity,"Our parent star, the Sun, also has its own mysteries. Let us explore some of its amazing and beautiful features which are observed by scientists regularly.","Sunspots are phenomenon which occurs on the Sun’s photosphere. These are seen as regions which are much darker than the surrounding regions. They appear darker as they have a lower temperature than their surroundings. Typical sunspots too have temperatures around 4000 degrees Kelvin. This is much cooler compared to the Sun’s surface temperature of around 6000 degrees Kelvin, which is actually the temperature of the photosphere. Sunspots have two parts – the Umbra and the Penumbra. The Umbra is the central part of the sunspot, which is the coolest part, and hence the darkest in appearance. The penumbra is a lighter area around the Umbral region, which is a little warmer then the central Umbra. The sunspots are caused due to the magnetic field of the sun, more specifically - magnetic field flux, accompanied by the differential rotation of the Sun, which causes the curling up of the magnetic flux tubes. The Sun takes around 25 days at the equator to complete one rotation, and it takes around 35 days for the same at the poles. The sunspots occur regularly and follow their own cycle. The number of sunspots and their activity keep changing throughout the 12 year solar cycle. As the sunspots are caused by magnetic flux, which indicates higher solar activity, mostly sunspots occur alongside events like solar flares, prominences and coronal mass ejections. Sunspots usually last for a few days to a few months on the Sun’s surface, contracting and expanding as they move across the Sun. They can range from about 10 miles in size to more than the diameter of ten Earths. Sunspots usually occur in pairs, and are sometimes observed in larger groups. A sunspot forming alone, i.e. as a single one, is a very rare phenomenon. Sunspots can be observed from the Earth using solar telescopes or telescopes fitted with a solar filter. This same phenomenon occurs in other stars too, and is called a star spot.","Occasionally, clouds of gases from the chromosphere will rise and orient themselves along the magnetic lines from sunspot pairs. These arches of gas are called solar prominences.  Prominences can last two to three months and can extend 30,000 miles (50,000 kilometers) or more above the sun's surface. Up­on reaching this height, they can erupt for a few minutes to hours and send large amounts of material racing through the corona and outward into space at 600 miles per second (1,000 kilometers per second); these eruptions are called coronal mass ejections.  Sometimes in complex sunspot groups, abrupt, violent explosions from the sun occur. These are called solar flares.  Solar flares are thought to be caused by sudden magnetic field changes in areas where the sun's magnetic field is concentrated. They're accompanied by the release of gas, electrons, visible light, ultraviolet light and X-rays. When this radiation and these particles reach the Earth's magnetic field, they interact with it at the poles to produce the auroras (borealis and australis). Solar flares can also disrupt communications, satellites, navigation systems and even power grids. The radiation and particles ionize the atmosphere and prevent the movement of radio waves between satellites and the ground or between the ground and the ground. The ionized particles in the atmosphere can induce electric currents in power lines and cause power surges. These power surges can overload a power grid and cause blackouts.",prominence,redgiant,sunparts,3568
Aurorae,"An aurora, sometimes referred to as polar lights, northern lights, or southern lights, is a natural light display in the Earth's sky, predominantly seen in the high-latitude regions. They are one of the most beautiful natural phenomenon to witness. So, how exactly are these coloured displays formed?","Aurorae are indicators of the connection between the Earth and the sun. The frequency of auroras correlates to the frequency of solar activity and the sun's 11-year cycle of activity.  As the process of fusion occurs inside the sun, it spews high-energy particles (ions, electrons, protons, neutrinos) and radiation in the solar wind. When the sun's activity is high, you'll also see large eruptions called solar flares and coronal mass ejections. These high-energy particles and radiations get released into space and travel throughout the solar system. When they hit the Earth, they encounter its magnetic field. The poles of the Earth's magnetic field lie near, but not exactly on, its geographic poles (where the planet spins on its axis). Scientists believe that the Earth's liquid iron outer core spins and makes the magnetic field. The field is distorted by the solar wind, getting compressed on the side facing the sun (bow shock) and drawn out on the opposite side (magnetotail). The solar winds create an opening in the magnetic field at the polar cusps. Polar cusps are found on the solar side of the magnetosphere (the area around the Earth that's influenced by the magnetic field). Let's look at how this leads to an aurora.","As the charged particles of solar winds and flares hit the Earth's magnetic field, they travel along the field lines. Some particles get deflected around the Earth, while others interact with the magnetic field lines, causing currents of charged particles within the magnetic fields to travel toward both poles -- this is why there are simultaneous auroras in both hemispheres. When an electric charge cuts across a magnetic field it generates an electric current. As these currents descend into the atmosphere along the field lines, they pick up more energy. When they hit the ionosphere region of the Earth's upper atmosphere, they collide with ions of oxygen and nitrogen. The particles impact the oxygen and nitrogen ions and transfer their energy to these ions. When the excited ions relax, the electrons in the oxygen and nitrogen atoms return to their original orbitals. In the process, they re-radiate the energy in the form of light. This light makes up the aurora, and the different colors come from light radiated from different ions.",aura,earthimg,mag,2582
Exoplanets,"All of the planets in our solar system orbit around the Sun. Planets that orbit around other stars are called exoplanets. Exoplanets are very hard to see directly with telescopes. They are hidden by the bright glare of the stars they orbit.  So, astronomers use other ways to detect and study these distant planets. They search for exoplanets by looking at the effects these planets have on the stars they orbit.","One way to search for exoplanets is to look for ""wobbly"" stars. A star that has planets doesn’t orbit perfectly around its center. From far away, this off-center orbit makes the star look like it’s wobbling. Hundreds of planets have been discovered using this method. However, only big planets—like Jupiter, or even larger—can be seen this way. Smaller Earth-like planets are much harder to find because they create only small wobbles that are hard to detect.","In 2009, NASA launched a spacecraft called Kepler to look for exoplanets. Kepler looked for planets in a wide range of sizes and orbits. And these planets orbited around stars that varied in size and temperature.  Some of the planets discovered by Kepler are rocky planets that are at a very special distance from their star. This sweet spot is called the habitable zone, where life might be possible. Kepler detected exoplanets using something called the transit method. When a planet passes in front of its star, it’s called a transit. As the planet transits in front of the star, it blocks out a little bit of the star's light. That means a star will look a little less bright when the planet passes in front of it.  Astronomers can observe how the brightness of the star changes during a transit. This can help them figure out the size of the planet. By studying the time between transits, astronomers can also find out how far away the planet is from its star. This tells us something about the planet’s temperature. If a planet is just the right temperature, it could contain liquid water—an important ingredient for life.",exoplanets,transit2,transit,1999
